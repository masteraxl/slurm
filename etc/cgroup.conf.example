#--
# Slurm cgroup plugins require a valid and functional 
# cgroup system mounted on /dev/cgroup
# When launched, plugins check cgroup availability
# If cgroup is not available, the plugin launch fails
# unless CgroupAutomount is set to yes. In that case,
# the plugin will first try to mount the cgroup system.
# CgroupMountOptions and CgroupReleaseAgent can be used to
# tune the cgroup system behavior
#--
CgroupAutomount=yes
CgroupMountOptions="memory,cpuset"
CgroupReleaseAgent="/etc/slurm/cgroup.release_agent"

#--
# Slurm cgroup proctrack plugin creates a hierarchical set of
# directories for each step, putting the step tasks into the leaf
#
# This directory structure is like the following : 
#     /dev/cgroup/slurm/uid_%uid/job_%jobid/step_%stepid
#
# job cgroup and jobstep cgroup can be tuned using the two next 
# parameters. The format of the parameter is the following :
#
# "a=b c=d e=f" where a,c,d corresponds to files under the cgroup 
# directory and b,d,f the values to write in these files
#--
JobCgroupParams="memory.swappiness=30"
JobStepCgroupParams=""

#--
# Slurm cgroup proctrack plugin can constrain memory usage at the job
# level. The constraints correspond to the amount of RAM space allowed
# to the whole job as well as the amount of additionnal swap space.
#
# The amount of space of these two notions are expressed in percent of
# the memory limit set to the job on the execution node.
#
# Thus, the following configuration :
#     ConstrainRAMSpace=no
#     ConstrainSwapSpace=yes
# will request that no constraint are set for the jobs,
#     ConstrainRAMSpace=yes
#     AllowedRAMSpace=100
#     ConstrainSwapSpace=yes
#     AllowedSwapSpace=10
# will request to constrain RAM and Swap space letting the job use
# as many RAM space than memory asked in slurm but not more than
# 110% of this limit in both RAM+Swap space
#
# Warning: setting ConstrainSwapSpace to yes automatically set 
# ConstrainRAMSpace to yes and the corresponding limit to 100%
# of the memory limit + the configured percent of Swap space
#--
ConstrainRAMSpace=yes
AllowedRAMSpace=100
ConstrainSwapSpace=yes
AllowedSwapSpace=10

#--
# Slurm cgroup proctrack plugin can constrain allowed cores to 
# the subset of allocated resources.
# To do that, you just have to set to yes the following parameter
#--
ConstrainCores=yes
