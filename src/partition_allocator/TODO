- read wiring into bluegene plugin
- read static config from file
- pass filename of wiring to system

done- debug, see why no parts of size num_nodes are coming out.
prob was incorrect external wiring 
done - clear up mem leak of destorying system

done - pa_init() resets system

done - add undo buffer
done   > redo create_pa_system, delete_pa_system and do copy_pa_system

done - input/output of 
  > static wiring
done > mark certain nodes as down

unneeded- add table to store results
  > partition sizes, geometery, coordinates?, torus/non-torus

done - touch projections
done - be able to translate out the geometry
done - add trace of coordinates into structures
unneeded - use symmetry of wiring to reduce size of problem.
unneeded- add functionality to query table

done- add permutations of switch with only 2 or 1 wire(s).
done- add complexity of another dimension.

done- how to indicate that a partition is toridal vs mesh?
  > brute force: traverse it
done > smarter -> keep track of non-toridal conns.  if none = torus.

done - switch to smarter graph checking (flexing) implementation.

done - if merging, remember to change all the internal connections
of the node to be the new label (ID)
