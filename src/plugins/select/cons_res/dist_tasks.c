/* To effectively deal with heterogeneous nodes, we fake a cyclic

 * _task_layout_block in src/common/dist_tasks.c. We do not need to
 * assign tasks to job->hostid[] and job->tids[][] at this point so
 * the cpu allocation is the same for cyclic and block.
 *
 * For the consumable resources support we need to determine what
 * "node/CPU/Core/thread"-tuplets will be allocated for a given job.
 * In the past we assumed that we only allocated one task per CPU (at
 * that point the lowest level of logical processor) and didn't allow
 * the use of overcommit. We have change this philosophy and are now
 * allowing people to overcommit their resources and expect the system
 * administrator to enable the task/affinity plug-in which will then
 * bind all of a job's tasks to its allocated resources thereby
 * avoiding interference between co-allocated running jobs.
 *
 * In the consumable resources environment we need to determine the
 * layout schema within slurmctld.
 *
 * We have a core_bitmap of all available cores. All we're doing here
 * is removing cores that are not needed based on the task count, and
 * the choice of cores to remove is based on the distribution:
 * - "cyclic" removes cores "evenly", starting from the last socket,
 * - "block" removes cores from the "last" socket(s)
 * - "plane" removes cores "in chunks"
