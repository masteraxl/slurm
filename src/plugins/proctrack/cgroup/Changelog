* Thu Jan 07 2010 Matthieu Hautreux <matthieu.hautreux@cea.fr>
- release 0.2
- fix a bug in memory limits calculation based on cgroup.conf 
  configuration parameters ( (a / b * c) becomes (a * (float) (b/c)) 
  which is better due to a, b and c being uint32_t values and roundness 
  issues)
- add new operations xcgroup_get_memlimit and xcgroup_get_memswlimit
- add a workaround to cope with a slurm-2.1.0 and previous versions
  limitation. job_mem field of slurmd_job_t corresponds to job steps
  limits and not to the job mem limit. Two distinct fields should be
  available in the future. In the meantime, we use job_mem value of
  each launched step and extend the amount of allowed memory (both
  ram and swap) if the the new amount is higher that the previous
  one

  proctrack/cgroup (skip POSIX threads reported by the cgroup during
  accounting)
