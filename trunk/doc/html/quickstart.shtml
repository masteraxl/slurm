<h1>Quick Start User Guide</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is an open source, 
fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job scheduling system 
for large and small Linux clusters. SLURM requires no kernel modifications for 
its operation and is relatively self-contained. As a cluster resource manager, 
SLURM has three key functions. First, it allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive 
access to resources (compute nodes) to users for some duration of time so they 
can perform work. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and 
monitoring work (normally a parallel job) on the set of allocated nodes. Finally, 
it arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of pending work.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>As depicted in Figure 1, SLURM consists of a <b>slurmd</b> daemon running on 
each compute node and a central <b>slurmctld</b> daemon running on a management node 
(with optional fail-over twin). 
The <b>slurmd</b> daemons provide fault-tolerant hierarchical communciations.
The user commands include: <b>sacct</b>, <b>salloc</b>, <b>sattach</b>,
<b>sbatch</b>, <b>sbcast</b>, <b>scancel</b>, <b>scontrol</b>,  
<b>sinfo</b>, <b>smap</b>, <b>squeue</b>, <b>srun</b>, <b>strigger</b> 
and <b>sview</b>.  
All of the commands can run anywhere in the cluster.</p>

<p>The entities managed by these SLURM daemons, shown in Figure 2, include 
<b>nodes</b>, the compute resource in SLURM, 
<b>partitions</b>, which group nodes into logical (possibly overlapping) sets, 
<b>jobs</b>, or allocations of resources assigned to a user for 
a specified amount of time, and 
<b>job steps</b>, which are sets of (possibly parallel) tasks within a job. 
The partitions can be considered job queues, each of which has an assortment of 
constraints such as job size limit, job time limit, users permitted to use it, etc.
Priority-ordered jobs are allocated nodes within a partition until the resources 
(nodes, processors, memory, etc.) within that partition are exhausted. Once 
a job is assigned a set of nodes, the user is able to initiate parallel work in 
the form of job steps in any configuration within the allocation. For instance, 
a single job step may be started that utilizes all nodes allocated to the job, 
or several job steps may independently use a portion of the allocation.</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>
<p>Man pages exist for all SLURM daemons, commands, and API functions. The command 
option <span class="commandline">--help</span> also provides a brief summary of 
options. Note that the command options are all case insensitive.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>sacct</b></span> is used to report job or job
step accounting information about active or completed jobs.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>salloc</b></span> is used to allocate resources 
for a job in real time. Typically this is used to allocate resources and spawn a shell. 
The shell is then used to execute srun commands to launch parallel tasks.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>sattach</b></span> is used to attach standard 
input, output, and error plus signal capabilities to a currently running 
job or job step. One can attach to and detach from jobs multiple times.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>sbatch</b></span> is used to submit a job script 
for later execution. The script will typically contain one or more srun commands 
to launch parallel tasks.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>sbcast</b></span> is used to transfer a file
from local disk to local disk on the nodes allocated to a job. This can be
used to effectively use diskless compute nodes or provide improved performance
relative to a shared file system.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>scancel</b></span> is used to cancel a pending
or running job or job step. It can also be used to send an arbitrary signal to
all processes associated with a running job or job step.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>scontrol</b></span> is the administrative tool
used to view and/or modify SLURM state. Note that many <span class="commandline">scontrol</span>
commands can only be executed as user root.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>sinfo</b></span> reports the state of partitions
and nodes managed by SLURM. It has a wide variety of filtering, sorting, and formatting
options.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>smap</b></span> reports state information for
jobs, partitions, and nodes managed by SLURM, but graphically displays the
information to reflect network topology.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>squeue</b></span> reports the state of jobs or
job steps. It has a wide variety of filtering, sorting, and formatting options.
By default, it reports the running jobs in priority order and then the pending
jobs in priority order.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>srun</b></span> is used to submit a job for
execution or initiate job steps in real time.
<span class="commandline">srun</span>
has a wide variety of options to specify resource requirements, including: minimum
and maximum node count, processor count, specific nodes to use or not use, and
specific node characteristics (so much memory, disk space, certain required 
features, etc.).
A job can contain multiple job steps executing sequentially or in parallel on
independent or shared nodes within the job's node allocation.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>smap</b></span> reports state information for 
jobs, partitions, and nodes managed by SLURM, but graphically displays the 
information to reflect network topology.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>strigger</b></span> is used to set, get or 
view event triggers. Event triggers include things such as nodes going down
or jobs approaching their time limit.</p>

<p><span class="commandline"><b>sview</b></span> is a graphical user interface to 
get and update state information for jobs, partitions, and nodes managed by SLURM.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Execute <span class="commandline">/bin/hostname</span> on four nodes (<span class="commandline">-N4</span>). 
Include task numbers on the output (<span class="commandline">-l</span>). The 
default partition will be used. One task per node will be used by default. </p>
<pre>
adev0: srun -N4 -l /bin/hostname
0: adev9
1: adev10
2: adev11
3: adev12
</pre> <p>Execute <span class="commandline">/bin/hostname</span> in four 
tasks (<span class="commandline">-n4</span>). Include task numbers on the output 
(<span class="commandline">-l</span>). The default partition will be used. One 
processor per task will be used by default (note that we don't specify a node 
count).</p>
<pre>
adev0: srun -n4 -l /bin/hostname
0: adev9
1: adev9
2: adev10
3: adev10
</pre> <p>Submit the script my.script for later execution.
Explicitly use the nodes adev9 and adev10 ("-w "adev[9-10]", note the use of a 
node range expression). 
We also explicitly state that the subsequent job steps will spawn four tasks 
each, which will insure that our allocation contains at least four processors
(one processor per task to be launched).
The output will appear in the file my.stdout ("-o my.stdout").
This script contains a timelimit for the job embedded within itself.
Other options can be supplied as desired by using a prefix of "#SBATCH" followed
by the option at the beginning of the script (before any commands to be executed
in the script).
Options supplied on the command line would override any options specified within
the script.
Note that my.script contains the command <span class="commandline">/bin/hostname</span> 
that executed on the first node in the allocation (where the script runs) plus 
two job steps initiated using the <span class="commandline">srun</span> command 
and executed sequentially.</p>
<pre>
adev0: cat my.script
#!/bin/sh
#SBATCH --time=1
/bin/hostname
srun -l /bin/hostname
srun -l /bin/pwd

adev0: sbatch -n4 -w &quot;adev[9-10]&quot; -o my.stdout my.script

<h2><a name="mpi">MPI</a></h2>
<p>MPI use depends upon the type of MPI being used. 
There are three fundamentally different modes of operation used 
by these various MPI implementation.
<ol>
<li>SLURM directly launches the tasks and performs initialization 
of communications (Quadrics MPI, MPICH2, MPICH-GM, MPICH-MX, 
MVAPICH, MVAPICH2 and some MPICH1 modes).</li>
<li>SLURM creates a resource allocation for the job and then
mpirun launches tasks using SLURM's infrastructure (OpenMPI,
LAM/MPI and HP-MPI).</li>
<li>SLURM creates a resource allocation for the job and then 
mpirun launches tasks using some mechanism other than SLURM, 
such as SSH or RSH (BlueGene MPI and some MPICH1 modes). 
These tasks initiated outside of SLURM's monitoring 
or control. SLURM's epilog should be configured to purge 
these tasks when the job's allocation is relinquished. </li>
</ol>
<p>Instructions for using several varieties of MPI with SLURM are
provided below.</p> 

<p> <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/"><b>Open MPI</b></a> relies upon
SLURM to allocate resources for the job and then mpirun to initiate the 
tasks. When using <span class="commandline">salloc</span> command, 
<span class="commandline">mpirun</span>'s -nolocal option is recommended. 
For example:
<pre>
$ salloc -n4 sh    # allocates 4 processors and spawns shell for job
&gt; mpirun -np 4 -nolocal a.out
&gt; exit          # exits shell spawned by initial salloc command
</pre>
<p>Note that any direct use of <span class="commandline">srun</span>
will only launch one task per node when the LAM/MPI plugin is used.
To launch more than one task per node usng the
<span class="commandline">srun</span> command, the <i>--mpi=none</i>
option will be required to explicitly disable the LAM/MPI plugin.</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.quadrics.com/"><b>Quadrics MPI</b></a> relies upon SLURM to 
allocate resources for the job and <span class="commandline">srun</span> 
to initiate the tasks. One would build the MPI program in the normal manner 
then initiate it using a command line of this sort:</p>
<pre>
$ srun [options] &lt;program&gt; [program args]
</pre>

<p> <a href="http://www.lam-mpi.org/"><b>LAM/MPI</b></a> relies upon the SLURM 
<span class="commandline">salloc</span> or <span class="commandline">sbatch</span>
command to allocate. In either case, specify 
the maximum number of tasks required for the job. Then execute the 
<span class="commandline">lamboot</span> command to start lamd daemons. 
<span class="commandline">lamboot</span> utilizes SLURM's 
<span class="commandline">srun</span> command to launch these daemons. 
Do not directly execute the <span class="commandline">srun</span> command 
to launch LAM/MPI tasks. For example: 
<pre>
$ salloc -n16 sh  # allocates 16 processors and spawns shell for job
&gt; lamboot
&gt; mpirun -np 16 foo args
1234 foo running on adev0 (o)
2345 foo running on adev1
etc.
&gt; lamclean
&gt; lamhalt
&gt; exit         # exits shell spawned by initial srun command
</pre>
<p>Note that any direct use of <span class="commandline">srun</span> 
will only launch one task per node when the LAM/MPI plugin is configured
as the default plugin.  To launch more than one task per node usng the 
<span class="commandline">srun</span> command, the <i>--mpi=none</i>
option would be required to explicitly disable the LAM/MPI plugin
if that is the system default.</p>

<p class="footer"><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.hp.com/go/mpi"><b>HP-MPI</b></a> uses the 
<span class="commandline">mpirun</span> command with the <b>-srun</b> 
option to launch jobs. For example:
<pre>
$MPI_ROOT/bin/mpirun -TCP -srun -N8 ./a.out
</pre></p>

<p><a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/"><b>
MPICH2</b></a> jobs 
are launched using the <b>srun</b> command. Just link your program with 
SLURM's implementation of the PMI library so that tasks can communicate
host and port information at startup. (The system administrator can add
these option to the mpicc and mpif77 commands directly, so the user will not 
need to bother). For example:
<pre>
$ mpicc -L&lt;path_to_slurm_lib&gt; -lpmi ...
$ srun -n20 a.out
</pre>
<b>NOTES:</b>
<ul>
<li>Some MPICH2 functions are not currently supported by the PMI 
libary integrated with SLURM</li>
<li>Set the environment variable <b>PMI_DEBUG</b> to a numeric value 
of 1 or higher for the PMI libary to print debugging information</li>
</ul></p>

<p><a href="http://www.myri.com/scs/download-mpichgm.html"><b>MPICH-GM</b></a>
jobs can be launched directly by <b>srun</b> command.
SLURM's <i>mpichgm</i> MPI plugin must be used to establish communications 
between the laucnhed tasks. This can be accomplished either using the SLURM 
configuration parameter <i>MpiDefault=mpichgm</i> in <b>slurm.conf</b>
or srun's <i>--mpi=mpichgm</i> option.
<pre>
$ mpicc ...
$ srun -n16 --mpi=mpichgm a.out
</pre>

<p><a href="http://www.myri.com/scs/download-mpichmx.html"><b>MPICH-MX</b></a>
jobs can be launched directly by <b>srun</b> command.
SLURM's <i>mpichmx</i> MPI plugin must be used to establish communications
between the laucnhed tasks. This can be accomplished either using the SLURM
configuration parameter <i>MpiDefault=mpichmx</i> in <b>slurm.conf</b>
or srun's <i>--mpi=mpichmx</i> option.
<pre>
$ mpicc ...
$ srun -n16 --mpi=mpichmx a.out
</pre>

<p><a href="http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/"><b>MVAPICH</b></a>
jobs can be launched directly by <b>srun</b> command.
SLURM's <i>mvapich</i> MPI plugin must be used to establish communications 
between the laucnhed tasks. This can be accomplished either using the SLURM 
configuration parameter <i>MpiDefault=mvapich</i> in <b>slurm.conf</b>
or srun's <i>--mpi=mvapich</i> option.
<pre>
$ mpicc ...
$ srun -n16 --mpi=mvapich a.out
</pre>
<b>NOTE:</b> If MVAPICH is used in the shared memory model, with all tasks
running on a single node, then use the <i>mpich1_shmem</i> MPI plugin instead.<br>
<b>NOTE (for system administrators):</b> Configure
<i>PropagateResourceLimitsExcept=MEMLOCK</i> in <b>slurm.conf</b> and 
start the <i>slurmd</i> daemons with an unlimited locked memory limit.
For more details, see 
<a href="http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/support/mvapich_user_guide.html#x1-420007.2.3">MVAPICH</a> 
documentation for "CQ or QP Creation failure".</p>

<p><a href="http://nowlab.cse.ohio-state.edu/projects/mpi-iba"><b>MVAPICH2</b></a>
jobs can be launched directly by <b>srun</b> command.
SLURM's <i>none</i> MPI plugin must be used to establish communications 
between the laucnhed tasks. This can be accomplished either using the SLURM 
configuration parameter <i>MpiDefault=none</i> in <b>slurm.conf</b> 
or srun's <i>--mpi=none</i> option. The program must also be linked with
SLURM's implementation of the PMI library so that tasks can communicate
host and port information at startup. (The system administrator can add
these option to the mpicc and mpif77 commands directly, so the user will not
need to bother).  <b>Do not use SLURM's MVAPICH plugin for MVAPICH2.</b>
<pre>
$ mpicc -L&lt;path_to_slurm_lib&gt; -lpmi ...
$ srun -n16 --mpi=none a.out
</pre>

<p><a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/bluegene/"><b>BlueGene MPI</b></a> relies 
upon SLURM to create the resource allocation and then uses the native
<span class="commandline">mpirun</span> command to launch tasks. 
Build a job script containing one or more invocations of the 
<span class="commandline">mpirun</span> command. Then submit 
the script to SLURM using <span class="commandline">sbatch</span>.
For example:</p>
<pre>
$ sbatch -N512 my.script
</pre>
<p>Note that the node count specified with the <i>-N</i> option indicates
the base partition count.
See <a href="bluegene.html">BlueGene User and Administrator Guide</a> 
for more information.</p>

<p><a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich1/"><b>MPICH1</b></a>
development ceased in 2005. It is recommended that you convert to 
MPICH2 or some other MPI implementation. 
If you still want to use MPICH1, note that it has several different 
programming models. If you are using the shared memory model 
(<i>DEFAULT_DEVICE=ch_shmem</i> in the mpirun script), then initiate 
the tasks using the <span class="commandline">srun</span> command 
with the <i>--mpi=mpich1_shmem</i> option.</p>
<pre>
$ srun -n16 --mpi=mpich1_shmem a.out
</pre>

<p>If you are using MPICH P4 (<i>DEFAULT_DEVICE=ch_p4</i> in 
the mpirun script) and SLURM version 1.2.11 or newer, 
then it is recommended that you apply the patch in the SLURM 
distribution's file <i>contribs/mpich1.slurm.patch</i>. 
Follow directions within the file to rebuild MPICH. 
Applications must be relinked with the new library.
Initiate tasks using the 
<span class="commandline">srun</span> command with the 
<i>--mpi=mpich1_p4</i> option.</p>
<pre>
$ srun -n16 --mpi=mpich1_p4 a.out
</pre>
<p>Note that SLURM launches one task per node and the MPICH 
library linked within your applications launches the other 
tasks with shared memory used for communications between them.
The only real anomaly is that all output from all spawned tasks
on a node appear to SLURM as coming from the one task that it
launched. If the srun --label option is used, the task ID labels
will be misleading.</p>
 
<p>Other MPICH1 programming models current rely upon the SLURM 
<span class="commandline">salloc</span> or 
<span class="commandline">sbatch</span> command to allocate resources.
In either case, specify the maximum number of tasks required for the job.
You may then need to build a list of hosts to be used and use that 
as an argument to the mpirun command. 
For example:
<pre>
$ cat mpich.sh
#!/bin/bash
srun hostname -s | sort -u >slurm.hosts
mpirun [options] -machinefile slurm.hosts a.out
rm -f slurm.hosts
$ sbatch -n16 mpich.sh
sbatch: Submitted batch job 1234
</pre>
<p>Note that in this example, mpirun uses the rsh command to launch 
tasks. These tasks are not managed by SLURM since they are launched 
outside of its control.</p>
