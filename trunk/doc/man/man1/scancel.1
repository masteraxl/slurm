.TH SCANCEL "1" "August 2007" "scancel 1.2" "Slurm components"

.SH "NAME"
scancel \- Used to signal jobs or job steps that are under the control of Slurm.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBscancel\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] [\fIjob_id\fR[.\fIstep_id\fR]] [\fIjob_id\fR[.\fIstep_id\fR]...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBscancel\fR is used to signal or cancel jobs or job steps. An arbitrary number 
of jobs or job steps may be signaled using job specification filters or a
space separated list of specific job and/or job step IDs. A job or job step 
can only be signaled by the owner of that job or user root. If an attempt is 
made by an unauthorized user to signal a job or job step, an error message will 
be printed and the job will not be signaled. 

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-batch\fR
Signal the batch job shell and its child processes.
This is not applicable if \fIstep_id\fR is specified.

.TP
\fB-\-ctld\fR
Send the job signal request to the slurmctld daemon rather than directly to the
slurmd daemons. This increases overhead, but offers better fault tolerance.

.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Print a help message describing all \fBscancel\fR options.

.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-interactive\fR
Interactive mode. Confirm each job_id.step_id before performing the cancel operation.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR=\fIjob_name\fR
The name of jobs to be signaled.

.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-partition\fR=\fIpartition_name\fR
The name of the partition from which jobs are to be signaled.

.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Do not report an error if the specified job is already completed.
This option is incompatible with the \fB\-\-verbose\fR option.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-signal\fR=\fIsignal_name\fR
The name or number of the signal to be send. 
If no signal is specified, the specified job or step will be terminated.

.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-state\fR=\fIjob_state_name\fR
The state of the jobs are to be signaled. \fIjob_state_name\fR may have a value of 
either "PENDING", "RUNNING" or "SUSPENDED".

.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-user\fR=\fIuser_name\fR
The name of the user whose jobs are to be signaled.

.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Print a brief help message listing the \fBscancel\fR options.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print additional logging. Multiple v's increase logging detail.
This option is incompatible with the \fB\-\-quiet\fR option.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-Version\fR
Print the version number of the scancel command. 

.TP
ARGUMENTS

.TP
\fIjob_id\fP
The Slurm job ID to be signaled.

.TP
\fIstep_id\fP
The step ID of the job step to be signaled. 
If not specified, the operation is performed at the level of a job.
When \fB\-\-batch\fR is used, the batch shell processes will be signalled.
Otherwise the processes associated with all job steps, but not the 
batch script itself, will be signalled.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
Some \fBscancel\fR options may be set via environment variables. These 
environment variables, along with their corresponding options, are listed below.

.SH "NOTES"
.LP
If multiple filters are supplied (e.g. \fB\-\-partition\fR and \fB\-\-name\fR) 
only the jobs satisfying all of the filtering options will be signaled.
.LP
If a signal value of "KILL" (the default value) is to be sent to an entire 
job, this will result in the job's termination and its resource allocation 
being released.
.LP
Cancelling a job step will not result in a job being terminated. 
The job must be cancelled to release a resource allocation. 

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP
Send SIGTERM to steps 1 and 3 of job 1234:
scancel \-\-signal=TERM 1234.1 1234.3

.TP
Cancel job 1234 along with all of its steps:
scancel 1234

.TP
Send SIGUSR1 to the batch shell processes of job 1235:
scancel \-\-signal=USR1 \-\-batch 1235

.TP
Cancel job all pending jobs belonging to user "bob" in partition "debug":
scancel \-\-state=PENDING \-\-user=bob \-\-partition=debug
