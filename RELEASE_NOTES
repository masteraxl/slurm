RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 1.4
6 October 2008


IMPORTANT NOTE:
SLURM state files in version 1.4 are different from those of version 1.3.
After installing SLURM version 1.4, plan to restart without preserving 
jobs or other state information. While SLURM version 1.3 is still running, 
cancel all pending and running jobs (e.g.
"scancel --state=pending; scancel --state=running"). Then stop and restart 
daemons with the "-c" option or use "/etc/init.d/slurm startclean".

There are substantial changes in the slurm.conf configuration file. It 
is recommended that you rebuild your configuration file using the tool
doc/html/configurator.html that comes with the distribution.

HIGHLIGHTS
* Idle nodes can now be completely powered down when idle and automatically
  restarted when their is work available. For more information see:
  https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/power_save.html
* SLURM has been modified to allocate specific cores to jobs and job steps in
  order to effectively preempt or gang schedule jobs.
* A new configuration parameter, PrologSlurmctld, can be used to support the 
  booting of different operating systems for each job.

CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES (see "man slurm.conf" for details)
* DefMemPerTask has been removed. Use DefMemPerCPU or DefMemPerNode instead.
* Added new node state of "FUTURE". These node records are created in SLURM
  tables for future use without a reboot of the SLURM daemons, but are not
   reported by any SLURM commands or APIs.
* Default AuthType is now "auth/munge" rather than auth/none.
* Default CryptoType is now "crypto/munge". OpenSSL is no longer required by
  SLURM in the default configuration.
* CompleteTime has been added to control how long to wait for a job's 
  completion before allocating already released resources to pending jobs.
* OverTimeLimit added to permit jobs to exceed their (soft) time limit by a
  configurable amount. Backfill scheduling will be based upon the soft time
  limit.
* DebugFlags added to provide detailed logging for specific subsystems.
* PrologSlurmctld has been aded and can be used to boot nodes into a particular
  state for each job.

COMMAND CHANGES (see man pages for details)
* --task-mem and --job-mem options have been removed from sall,c sbatch and
  srun. Use --mem-per-cpu or --mem instead.
* --ctrl-comm-ifhn-addr option has been removed from the srun comma.d
