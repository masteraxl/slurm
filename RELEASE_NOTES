RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 2.1
1 June 2009 (after SLURM 2.1.0-pre1)


IMPORTANT NOTE:
SLURM state files in version 2.1 are different from those of version 2.0.
After installing SLURM version 2.1, plan to restart without preserving 
jobs or other state information. While SLURM version 2.0 is still running, 
cancel all pending and running jobs (e.g.
"scancel --state=pending; scancel --state=running"). Then stop and restart 
daemons with the "-c" option or use "/etc/init.d/slurm startclean".

If using the slurmdbd (SLURM DataBase Daemon) you must update this first.  
The 2.1 slurmdbd will work with SLURM daemons at version 2.0.0 and above.  
You will not need to update all clusters at the same time, but it is very 
important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before updating 
any other clusters making use of it.  No real harm will come from updating 
your systems before the slurmdbd, but they will not talk to each other 
until you do.

There are substantial changes in the slurm.conf configuration file. It 
is recommended that you rebuild your configuration file using the tool
doc/html/configurator.html that comes with the distribution.
