RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 1.3
6 June 2007


IMPORTANT NOTE:
SLURM state files in version 1.3 are different from those of version 1.2.
After installing SLURM version 1.2, plan to restart without preserving 
jobs or other state information. Restart daemons with the "-c" option or 
use "/etc/init.d/slurm startclean".

COMMAND CHANGES

* The srun options --allocate, --attach and --batch have been removed.
  Use the new commands added in SLURM version 1.2 for this functionality:
  salloc  - Create a job allocation (functions like "srun --allocate")
  sattach - Attach to an existing job step (functions like "srun --attach")
  sbatch  - Submit a batch job script (functions like "srun --batch")
  See the individual man pages for more information. 
* The slaunch command has been removed. Use the srun command instead.
* The srun option --exclusive has been added for job steps to be 
  allocated processors not already assigned to other job steps. This 
  can be used to execute multiple job steps simultaneously within a 
  job allocation and have SLURM perform resource management for the 
  job steps much like it does for jobs. If dedicated resources are 
  not immediately available, the job step will be executed later 
  unless the --immediate option is also set.

CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES

* Added new parameter "PrivateData" which can be used to prevent users 
  from being able to view jobs or job steps belonging to other users.
* Added configuration parameters for node power save mode: ResumeProgram
  ResumeRate, SuspendExcNodes, SuspendExcParts, SuspendProgram and SuspendRate.
* Job accounting and termination data can be written to a database as specified 
  by these new parameters: DatabaseType (flatfile, mysql, and pgsql), 
  DatabaseHost, DatabasePass, DatabasePort, and DatabaseUser.
* Added new paramter "CryptoType" to specify digital signature plugin to 
  be used. Currenly only supports crypto/openssl.
* See "man slurm.conf" for more information.

OTHER CHANGES

* New node state "FAILING" added along with event trigger for it.

See the file NEWS for more details.
