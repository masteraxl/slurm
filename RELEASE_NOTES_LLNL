LLNL-SPECIFIC RELEASE NOTES FOR SLURM VERSION 2.0
19 February 2009

For processor-scheduled clusters (*not* allocating whole nodes to jobs):
Set "DefMemPerCPU" and "MaxMemPerCPU" as appropriate to restrict memory 
available to a job. Also set "JobAcctGatherType=jobacct_gather/linux"
for enforcement (periodic sampling of memory use by the job).

Configure "TaskPlugin=task/affinity" and remove the "auto-affinity.so"
SPANK plugin with equivalent functionality.

Remove the "preserve-env.so" SPANK plugin. The functionality is now
directly in SLURM.

SLURM version 2.0 must use a database daemon (slurmdbd) at version 2.0
or higher. While we are testing version 2.0, set "AccountingStoragePort=????".
Once we upgrade the production slurmdbd to version 2.0, this change will
not be required. 

SLURM state files in version 2.0 are different from those of version 1.3.
After installing SLURM version 2.0, plan to restart without preserving 
jobs or other state information. While SLURM version 1.3 is still running, 
cancel all pending and running jobs (e.g.
"scancel --state=pending; scancel --state=running"). Then stop and restart 
daemons with the "-c" option or use "/etc/init.d/slurm startclean".
