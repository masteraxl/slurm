    message.
 -- For "srun --attach=X" to other users job, report an error and exit (it 
    previously just hung).
 -- BLUEGENE - fix for doing correct small block logic on user error. 
 -- BLUEGENE - Added support in slurmd to create a fake libdb2.so if it
    doesn't exist so smap won't seg fault

    or static linking with the bridgeapi.

* Changes in SLURM 1.1.1
========================

    job as CANCELLED rather than COMPLETED and change its start and end time 
    to that time.
 -- Fix bug in PMI support that prevented use of second PMI_Barrier call.
    This fix is needed for MVAPICH2 use.

========================
 -- Fix bug that could temporarily make nodes DOWN when they are really 
    responding. 
 -- Fix bug preventing backup slurmctld from responding to PING RPCs.

 -- Set job's num_proc correctly for jobs that do not have exclusive use 
    of it's allocated nodes.
 -- Change in support for test suite: 'testsuite/expect/globals.example'
    is now 'testsuite/expect/globals' and you can override variable 
    settings with a new file 'testsuite/expect/globals.local'.
 -- Job suspend now sends SIGTSTP, sleep(1), sends SIGSTOP for better
    MPI support.
 -- Plug a bunch of memory leaks in various places.

    to make sure they aren't in error state.
 -- Change time format in job completion logging (JobCompType=jobcomp/filetxt)
    from "MM/DD HH:MM:SS" to "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS", conforming with the ISO8601

* Changes in SLURM 1.1.0-pre6
=============================
 -- Added logic to "stat" a running job with sacct option -S use -j to specify
    job.step 
 -- removed jobacct/bluegene (no real need for this) meaning, I don't think 
    there is a way to gather the data yet.

=============================
 -- Added step completion RPC logic
 -- Vastly changed sacct and the jobacct plugin.  Read documentation for full
    details.
 -- Added jobacct plugin for AIX and BlueGene, they currently don't work, 
    but infrastructure is in place.

    address (Hongjia Cao, National University of Defense Technology).
 -- Moved safe_read/write to slurm_protocol_defs.h removing multiple copies.
 -- Remove vestigial functions slurm_allocate_resources_and_run() and 
    slurm_free_resource_allocation_and_run_response_msg().
 -- Added support for different executable files and arguments by task based
    upon a configuration file. See srun's --multi-prog option (based upon 
    work by Hongjia Cao, National University of Defense Technology).
 -- moved the way forward logic waited for fanout logic mostly eliminating 
    problems with scalability issues.
 -- changed -l option in sacct to display different params see sacct/sacct.h

    free/error via scontrol update BlockName 
 -- Add needed symbol to select/bluegene in order to load plugin.

* Changes in SLURM 1.1.0-pre3
=============================
 -- Added framework for XCPU job launch support.
 -- New general configuration file parser and slurm.conf handling code.
    Allows long lines to be continued on the next line by ending with a "\".
    Whitespace is allowed between the key and "=", and between the "=" and
    value.
    WARNING: A NodeName may now occur only once in a slurm.conf file.
             If you want to temporarily make nodes DOWN in the slurm.conf,
             use the new DownNodes keyword (see "man slurm.conf").
 -- Gracefully handle request to submit batch job from within an existing 
    batch job.
 -- Warn user attempting to create a job allocation from within an existing job
    allocation.
 -- Add web page description for proctrack plugin.
 -- Add new function slurm_get_rem_time() for job's time limit.
 -- JobAcct plugin renamed from "log" to "linux" in preparation for support of 
    new system types. 
    WARNING: "JobAcctType=jobacct/log" is no longer supported.
 -- Removed vestigal 'bg' names from bluegene plugin and smap
 -- InactiveLimit parameter is not enforced for RootOnly partitions.
 -- Update select/cons_res web page (Susanne Balle, HP, 
    cons_res_doc_patch_3_29_06).
 -- Build a "slurmd.test" along with slurmd. slurmd.test has the path to 
    slurmstepd set allowing it to run unmodified out of the builddir for 
    testing (Mark Grondona).
 
* Changes in SLURM 1.1.0-pre2
=============================
 -- Added "bcast" command to transmit copies of a file to compute nodes
    with message fanout.
 -- Bluegene specific - Added support for overlapping partitions and 
    dynamic partitioning. 
 -- Bluegene specific - Added support for nodecard sized blocks.
 -- Added logic to accept 1k for 1024 and so on for --nodes option of srun. 
    This logic is through display tools such as smap, sinfo, scontrol, and 
    squeue.
 -- Added bluegene.conf man page.
 -- Added support for memory affinity, see srun --mem_bind option.
 
* Changes in SLURM 1.1.0-pre1
=============================
 -- New --enable-multiple-slurmd configure parameter to allow running
    more than one copy of slurmd on a node at the same time.  Only
    really useful for developers.
 -- New communication is now branched on all processes to slurmd's from 
    slurmctld and srun launch command.  This is done with a tree type 
    algorithm.  Spawn and batch mode work the same as before.  New slurm.conf
    variable TreeWidth=50 is default.  This is the number of threads per 
    stop on the tree.  
 -- Configuration parameter HeartBeatInterval is depracated. Now used half
    of SlurmdTimeout and SlurmctldTimeout for communications to slurmd and
    slurmctld daemons repsectively.
 -- Add hash tables for select/cons_res plugin (Susanne Balle, HP, 
    patch_02222006).
 -- Remove some use of cr_enabled flag in slurmctld job record, use 
    new flag "test_only" in select_g_job_test() instead.

* Changes in SLURM 1.0.15
=========================
 -- In srun, reset stdin to blocking mode (if it was originally blocking before

    srun under a bash shell in an emacs *shell* buffer.

* Changes in SLURM 1.0.14
=========================
 -- Fix for bad xfree() call in auth/munge which can raise an assert().

=========================
 -- Fix for AllowGroups option to work when the /etc/group file doesn't 
    contain all users in group by adding the uids of the names in /etc/passwd
    that have a gid of that which we are looking for.
 -- Fix bug in InactiveLimit support that can potentially purge active jobs.
    NOTE: This is highly unlikely except on very large AIX clusters.
 -- Fix bug for reiniting the config_lock around the control_file in 
    slurm_protocol_api.c logic has changed in 1.1 so no need to merge
 
* Changes in SLURM 1.0.12
=========================
 -- Report node state of DRAIN rather than DOWN if DOWN with DRAIN flag set.
 -- Initialize job->mail_type to 0 (NONE) for job submission.

    HP, sacct_buf.patch).
 -- BLUEGENE SPECIFIC - added load function to smap to load an already 
    exsistant bluegene.conf file.
 -- Fix bug in sacct: If user requests specific job or job step ID,

 -- Removes the slurmd's use of SysV shared memory.  Instead the slurmd
    communicates with the slurmstepd processes through the slurmstepd's
    new named unix domain socket.  The "stepd_api" is used to talk to the
    slurmstepd (src/slurmd/common/stepd_api.[ch]).
 -- Bluegene specific - bluegene block allocator will find most any 
    partition size now.  Added support to start at any point in smap 
    to request a partition instead of always starting at 000.
 -- Bluegene specific - Support to smap to down or bring up nodes in 
    configure mode.  Added commands include allup, alldown, 
    up [range], down [range]
 -- Time format in sinfo/squeue/smap/sacct changed from D:HH:MM:SS to 
    D-HH:MM:SS per POSIX standards document.
 -- Treat scontrol update request without any requested changes as an 
    error condition.

    into bluegene plugin and renamed block_allocator.  Format for bluegene.conf
    file changed also.  Read bluegene html page.  Code is backwards compatable
    smap will generate in new form
 -- Add srun option --nice to give user some control over job priority.

* Changes in SLURM 0.7.0-pre3

    of a job-step.  srun and slurmd comminicate over the TCP stream using a
    simple messaging protocol.
 -- Added task plugin and use task prolog/epilog(s).
 -- New slurmd_step functionality added.  Fork exec instead of using shared
    memory.  Not completely tested.
 -- BGL small partition logic in place in plugin and smap.  Scheduler needs  
    to be rewritten to handle multiple partitions on a single node. No 
    documentation written on process yet.
 -- If running select/bluegene plugin without access to BGL DB2, then 
    full-system bglblock is of system size defined in bluegene.conf.

    REQUEST_KILL_JOB/TASKS changed to REQUEST_SIGNAL_JOB/TASKS.
 -- Add support for e-mail notification on job state changes.
 -- Some infrastructure added for task launch controls (slurm.conf:
    TaskProlog, TaskEpilog, TaskPlugin; srun --task-prolog, --task-epilog).

* Changes in SLURM 0.6.11
=========================
 -- Fix bug in sinfo partition sorting order.
 -- Fix bugs in srun use of #SLURM options in batch script.

=========================
 -- Fix for slurmd job termination logic (could hang in COMPLETING state).
 -- Sacct bug fixes: Report correct user name for job step, show "uid.gid"

    committed
 -- Make slurmd step manager retry slurm_container_destroy() indefinitely

    completing until the container destroy succeeds.

* Changes in SLURM 0.6.0-pre7
=============================
 -- Disable localtime_r() calls from forked processes (semaphore set 
    in another pthread can deadlock calls to localtime_r made from

 -- Added new error code ESLURM_FRAGMENTED for immediate resource 
    allocation requests which are refused due to completing job (formerly 
    returned ESLURM_NOT_TOP_PRIORITY)
 -- Modified job completion logging plugin calling sequence.
 -- Added much of the infrastructure required for system checkpoint
    (APIs, RPCs, and NULL plugin)

* Changes in SLURM 0.3.5
========================
 -- Fix "SLURM_RLIMIT_* not found in environment" error message when
    distributing large rlimit to jobs.
 -- Add support for slurm_spawn() and associated APIs (needed for IBM 
    SP systems).
 -- Fix bug in update of node state to DRAINING/DRAINED when update 
    request occurs prior to initial node registration.
 -- Fix bug in purging of batch jobs (active batch jobs were being 
    improperly purged starting in version 0.3.0).
 -- When updating a node state to DRAINING/DRAINED a Reason must be 
    provided. The user name and a timestamp will automatically be 
    appended to that Reason.

========================
 -- The srun command wakes immeditely upon resource allocation (via new RPC)
    rather than polling.
 -- SLURM daemons log current version number at startup.
 -- If slurmd can't respond to ping (e.g. paging is keeping it from 
    responding in a timely fashion) then send a registration RPC
    to slurmctld.
 -- Fix slurmd -M option to call mlockall() after daemonizing.
 -- Add "slurm_" prefix to slurm's hostlist_ function man pages.

 -- Fix for slurmd spinning when stdin buffers full (gnats:434)
 -- Change some slurmctld malloc sizes to reduce demand for realloc calls, 
    improves performance and eliminates realloc failure on RH EL3 under 
    extremely heavy workload apparently due to memory fragmentation.
 -- Fix scheduling logic for heterogeneous processor count.
 -- Modify security_2_2 test to function with release 0.3
 -- Fix broken rpm build when libslurm not already installed.

    shell when using --allocate, -A.
 -- Modify  srun --uid=user and --gid=group options to maintain invoking 
    user's credentials until after nodes have been allocated to requested 
    user/group (allows root to run jobs and allocate nodes for other users 
    in a RootOnly partition).
 -- Fix node processing if state change requested via scontrol prior to 
    initial node registration.
 
* Changes in SLURM 0.3.0
========================
 -- Support for AIX added (a few bugs do remain).
 -- Fix memory leak in slurmctld, slurm_cred_create().
 -- On ELF systems, export BNR_* functions from SLURM API. 
 -- Add support for "hidden" partitions (applies to their 
    nodes, jobs, and job steps as well). APIs and commands 
    modified to optionally display hidden partitions.
 -- Modify partition's group_allow test to be based upon the user 
    of the allocation rather than the user making the allocation 
    request (user root for LCRM batch jobs).
 -- Restructure plugin directory structure.
 -- New --core=type option in srun for lightweight corefile support.
    (requires liblwcf).

    slurm.conf pathname).
 -- Remove slurmd "-f" option.
 -- Several documenation changes for slurm administrators.
 -- On ELF systems, export only slurm_* functions from slurm API and 
    ensure plugins use only slurm_ prefixed functions (created aliases
    where necessary).
 -- New srun option -Q, --quiet to suppress informational messages.
 -- Fix bug in slurmctld's building of nodelist for job (failed if 
    more than one numeric field in node name).
 -- Change "scontrol completing" and "sinfo" to use job's node bitmap
    to identify nodes associated with that particular job that are 
    still processing job completion. This will work properly for 
    shared nodes.
 -- Set SLURM_DISTRIBUTION environment varible for user tasks.
 -- Fix for file descriptor leak in slurmd.
 -- Propagate stacksize limit to jobs along with other resource limits
    that were previously ignored.

    nodes along with their REASON field.

* Changes in SLURM 0.3.0.0-pre8
===============================
 -- Queue outgoing message traffic rather than immediately spawning 
    pthreads (under heavy load this resulted in hundreds of pthreads

 -- Sinfo sort partitions in slurm.conf order, new sort option ("#P").
 -- Document how to gracefully change plugin values.
 -- Slurmctld does not attempt to recover jobs when the switch plugin
    value changes (decision reached when any job's switch state recovery
    fails).
 -- Node does not transition from COMPLETING to DOWN state due to
    not responding. Wait for tasks to complete or admin to set DOWN.
 -- Always chmod SlurmdSpoolDir to 755 (a umask of 007 was resulting 
    in batch jobs failing).
 -- Return errors when trying to change configuration parameters
    AuthType, SchedulerType, and SwitchType via "scontrol reconfig"
    or SIGHUP. Document how to safely change these parameters.
 -- Plugin-specific error number definitions and descriptive strings 
    moved from common into plugin modules.

 -- Added -q,--quit-on-interrupt option to srun.
 -- Elan switch plugin now starts neterr resolver thread on all Elan3
    systems (QsNet and QsNetII).
 -- Added some missing read locks for references for slurmctld's 
    configuration data structure
 -- Modify processing of queued slurmctld message traffic to get better
    throughput (resulted in job inactivity limit being reached improperly 
    when hundreds of jobs running simultaneously)

    to ignore SIGTERM)
 -- Sinfo "--exact" option only applies to fields actually displayed
 -- Partition processor count not correctly computed for heterogeneous 
    clusters with FastSchedule=0 configuration
 -- Only return DOWN nodes to service if the reason for them being in 
    that state is non-responsiveness and "ReturnToService=1" configuration
 -- Partition processor count now correctly computed for heterogeneous 
    clusters with FastSchedule configured off
 -- New macros and function to export SLURM version number

     losing track of jobs
   - slurm/329: Job processing may be left running when one task dies
   - slurm/333: Slurmd fails to launch a job and deletes a step, due to 
     a race condition in shared memory management
   - slurm/334: Slurmd was getting a segv due to a race condition in shared 
     memory management
   - slurm/342: Properly handle nodes being removed from configuration

   - slurm/312: Freeing non-allocated memory and killing slurmd
 -- Assorted changes to support RedHat Enterprise Linux 3.0 and IA64
 -- Initial Elan4 and libelanctrl support (--with-elan).

    rather than previously saved state. Additional improvements to 
    avoid inconsistent job/node/partition states at restart. Job state 
    information is used to arbitrate conflicts.
 -- Orphaned file descriptors eliminated.

* Changes in SLURM 0.2.16
=========================
 -- Fixes for reported problems:
   - slurm/265: Early termination of srun could cause job to remain in queue.
