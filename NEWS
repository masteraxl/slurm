This file describes changes in recent versions of SLURM. It primarily
documents those changes that are of interest to users and admins.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.0-pre2
=============================
 -- Added support for smap to query off node name for display.
 -- Slurmdbd modified to set user ID and group ID to SlurmUser if started as 
    user root.
 -- Configuration parameter ControlMachine changed to  accept multiple comma-
    separated hostnames for support of some high-availability architectures.
 -- ALTERED API CALL slurm_get_job_steps 0 has been changed to NO_VAL for both
    job and step id to recieve all jobs/steps.  Please make adjustments to
    your code.
 -- salloc's --wait=<secs> option deprecated by --immediate=<secs> option to 
    match the srun command.
 -- Add new slurmctld list for node features with node bitmaps for simplified
    scheduling logic.
 -- Multiple features can be specified when creating a reservation. Use "&" 
    (AND) or "|" (OR) separators between the feature names.
 -- Changed internal node name caching so that front-end mode would work with
    multiple lines of node name definitions. 
 -- Add node state flag for power-up/configuring. Represented by "#" suffix
    on the node state name (e.g. "ALLOCATED#") for command output.

* Changes in SLURM 2.1.0-pre1
=============================
 -- Slurmd notifies slurmctld of node boot time to better clean up after node
    reboots.
 -- Slurmd sends node registration information repeatedly until successful
    transmit.
 -- Change job_state in job structure to dedicate 8-bits to state flags. 
    Added macros to get state information (IS_JOB_RUNNING(job_ptr), etc.)
 -- Added macros to get node state information (IS_NODE_DOWN(node_ptr), etc).
 -- Added support for Solaris. Patch from David Hoppner.
 -- Rename "slurm-aix-federation-<version>.rpm" to just 
    "slurm-aix-<version>.rpm" (federation switch plugin may not be present).
 -- Eliminated the redundant squeue output format and sort options of 
    "%o" and "%b". Use "%D" and "%S" formats respectively. Also eliminated 
    "%X" and "%Y" and "%Z" formats. Use "%z" instead.
 -- Added mechanism for SPANK plugins to set environment variables for
    Prolog, Epilog, PrologSLurmctld and EpilogSlurmctld programs using
    the functions spank_get_job_env, spank_set_job_env, and 
    spank_unset_job_env. See "man spank" for more information.
 -- Completed the work to begun in 2.0.0 to standardize on using '-Q' as the
    --quiet flag for all the commands.
 -- BLUEGENE - sinfo and sview now display correct cpu counts for partitions
 -- Cleaned up the cons_res plugin.  It now uses a ptr to a part_record
    instead of having to do strcmp's to find the correct one.
 -- Pushed most all the plugin specific info in src/common/node_select.c 
    into the respected plugin.
 -- BLUEGENE - closed some corner cases where a block could had been removed 
    while a job was waiting for it to become ready because an underlying 
    part of the block was put into an error state.
 -- Modify sbcast logic to prevent a user from moving files to nodes they
    have not been allocated (this would be possible in previous versions
    only by hacking the sbcast code).
 -- Add contribs/sjstat script (Perl tool to report job state information).
    Put into new RPM: sjstat.
 -- Add sched/wiki2 (Moab) JOBMODIFY command support for VARIABLELIST option
    to set supplemental environment variables for pending batch jobs.
 -- BLUEGENE - add support for scontrol show blocks.
 -- Added support for job step time limits.

* Changes in SLURM 2.0.4
========================
 -- Permit node suspend/resume logic to be enabled through "scontrol reconfig"
    given appropriate changes to slurm configuration file.
 -- Check for return codes on functions with warn_unused_result set
 -- Fix memory leak in getting step information
 -- Better logging for when job's request bad output file locations.
 -- Fix issue where if user specified non-existant file to write to slurmstepd
    will regain privileges before sending batch script ended to the controller.
 -- Fix bug when using the priority_multifactor plugin with no associations yet.
 -- BLUEGENE - we no longer check for the images to sync state.  This was 
    needed long ago when rebooting blocks wasn't a possibility and should 
    had been removed when that functionality was available.
 -- Added message about no connection with the database for sacctmgr.
 -- On BlueGene, let srun or salloc exit on SIGINT if slurmctld dies while
    booting its block.

* Changes in SLURM 2.0.3
========================
 -- Add reservation creation/update flag of Ignore_Jobs to enable the creation
    of a reservation that overlaps jobs expected to still be running when
    the reservation starts. This would be especially useful to reserve all 
    nodes for system maintenence without adjusting time limits of running
    jobs before creating the reservation. Without this flag, nodes allocated
    jobs expected to running when the reservation begins can not be placed 
    into a reservation.
 -- In task/affinity plugin, add layer of abstraction to logic translating
    block masks to physical machine masks. Patch from Matthieu Hautreux, CEA.
 -- Fix for setting the node_bitmap in a job to NULL if the job does not 
    start correctly when expected to start.
 -- Fixed bug in srun --pty logic. Output from the task was split up 
    arbitrarily into stdout and stderr streams, and sometimes was printed 
    out of order.
 -- If job requests minimum and maximum node count range with select/cons_res,
    try to satisfy the higher value (formerly only allocated the minimum).
 -- Fix for checking for a non-existant job when querying steps.
 -- For job steps with the --exclusive option, base initial wait time in 
    partly upon the process ID for better performance with many job steps 
    started at the same time. Maintain exponential back-off as needed.
 -- Fix for correct step ordering in sview.
 -- Support optional argument to srun and salloc --immediate option. Specify
    timeout value in seconds for job or step to be allocated resources.

* Changes in SLURM 2.0.2
========================
 -- Fix, don't remove job details when a job is cancelled while pending.
 -- Do correct type for mktime so garbage isn't returned on 64bit systems 
    for accounting archival.
 -- Better checking in sacctmgr to avoid infinite loops.
 -- Fix minor memory leak in fake_slurm_step_layout_create()
 -- Fix node weight (scheduling priority) calculation for powered down
    nodes. Patch from Hongjia Cao, NUDT.
 -- Fix node suspend/resume rate calculations. Patch from Hongjia Cao, NUDT.
 -- Change calculations using ResumeRate and SuspendRate to provide higher
    resolution.
 -- Log the IP address for incoming messages having an invalid protocol 
    version number.
 -- Fix for sacct to show jobs that start the same second as the sacct
    command is issued.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix for -n option to work on correct cpu counts for each 
    midplane instead of treating -n as a c-node count.
 -- salloc now sets SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE if --ntasks-per-node option is set.
 -- Fix select/linear to properly set a job's count of allocated processors
    (all processors on the allocated nodes).
 -- Fix select/cons_res to allocate proper CPU count when --ntasks-per-node
    option is used without a task count in the job request.
 -- Insure that no node is allocated to a job for which the CPU count is less
    than --ntasks-per-node * --cpus-per-task.
 -- Correct AllocProcs reported by "scontrol show node" when ThreadsPerCore
    is greater than 1 and select/cons_res is used.
 -- Fix scontrol show config for accounting information when values are 
    not set in the slurm.conf.
 -- Added a set of SBATCH_CPU_BIND* and SBATCH_MEM_BIND* env variables to keep
    jobsteps launched from within a batch script from inheriting the CPU and
    memory affinity that was applied to the batch script. Patch from Matthieu
    Hautreux, CEA.
 -- Ignore the extra processors on a node above configured size if either 
    sched/gang or select/cons_res is configured.
 -- Fix bug in tracking memory allocated on a node for select/cons_res plugin.
 -- Fixed a race condition when writing labelled output with a file per task
    or per node, which potentially closed a file before all data was written.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix, for if a job comes in spanning both less than and 
    over 1 midplane in size we check the connection type appropriately.
 -- Make sched/backfill properly schedule jobs with constraints having node 
    counts. NOTE: Backfill of jobs with constraings having exclusive OR 
    operators are not fully supported.  
 -- If srun is cancelled by SIGINT, set the job state to cancelled, not 
    failed.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix, for if you are setting an subbp into an error mode 
    where the subbp stated isn't the first ionode in a nodecard.
 -- Fix for backfill to not core when checking shared nodes.
 -- Fix for scontrol to not core when hitting just return in interactive mode.
 -- Improve sched/backfill logic with respect to shared nodes (multiple jobs
    per node).
 -- In sched/wiki (Maui interface) add job info fields QOS, RCLASS, DMEM and
    TASKSPERNODE. Patch from Bjorn-Helge Mevik, University of Oslo.

* Changes in SLURM 2.0.1
========================
 -- Fix, truncate time of start and end for job steps in sacct.
 -- Initialize all messages to slurmdbd. Previously uninitialized string could
    cause slurmctld to fail with invalid memory reference.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix, for when trying to finish a torus on a block already 
    visited.  Even though this may be possible electrically this isn't valid
    in the under lying infrastructure.
 -- Fix, in mysql plugins change mediumints to int to support full 32bit 
    numbers.
 -- Add sinfo node state filtering support for NO_RESPOND, POWER_SAVE, FAIL, 
    MAINT, DRAINED and DRAINING states. The state filter of DRAIN still maps
    to any node in either DRAINED or DRAINING state.
 -- Fix reservation logic when job requests specific nodes that are already
    in some reservation the job can not use.
 -- Fix recomputation of a job's end time when allocated nodes which are
    being powered up. The end time would be set in the past if the job's
    time limit was INFINITE, resulting in it being prematurely terminated.
 -- Permit regular user to change the time limit of his pending jobs up to
    the partition's limit.
 -- Fix "-Q" (quiet) option for salloc and sbatch which was previously 
    ignored.
 -- BLUEGENE - fix for finding odd shaped blocks in dynamic mode.
 -- Fix logic supporting SuspendRate and ResumeRate configuration parameters.
    Previous logic was changing state of one too many nodes per minute.
 -- Save new reservation state file on shutdown (even if no changes).
 -- Fix, when partitions are deleted the sched and select plugins are notified.
 -- Fix for slurmdbd to create wckeyid's when they don't exist
 -- Fix linking problem that prevented checkpoint/aix from working.

* Changes in SLURM 2.0.0
========================
 -- Fix for bluegene systems to be able to create 32 node blocks with only 
    16 psets defined in dynamic layout mode.
 -- Improve srun_cr handling of child srun forking. Patch from Hongjia Cao, 
    NUDT.
 -- Configuration parameter ResumeDelay replaced by SuspendTimeout and 
    ResumeTimeout.
 -- BLUEGENE - sview/sinfo now displays correct cnode numbers for drained nodes
    or blocks in error state.
 -- Fix some batch job launch bugs when powering up suspended nodes.
 -- Added option '-T' for sacct to truncate time of start and end and set
    default of --starttime to Midnight of current day.

* Changes in SLURM 2.0.0-rc2
============================
 -- Change fanout logic to start on calling node instead of first node in 
    message nodelist.
 -- Fix bug so that smap builds properly on Sun Constellation system.
 -- Filter white-space out from node feature specification.
 -- Fixed issue with duration not being honored when updating start time in 
    reservations.
 -- Fix bug in sched/wiki and sched/wiki2 plugins for reporting job resource
    allocation properly when node names are configured out of sort order 
    with more than one numeric suffix (e.g. "tux10-1" is configured after 
    "tux5-1").
 -- Avoid re-use of job_id (if specified at submit time) when the existing
    job is in completing state (possible race condition with Moab).
 -- Added SLURM_DISTRIBUTION to env for salloc.
 -- Add support for "scontrol takeover" command for backup controller to 
    assume control immediately. Patch from Matthieu Hautreux, CEA.
 -- If srun is unable to communicate with the slurmd tasks are now marked as 
    failed with the controller.
 -- Fixed issues with requeued jobs not being accounted for correctly in 
    the accounting.
 -- Clear node's POWER_SAVE flag if configuration changes to one lacking a
    ResumeProgram.
 -- Extend a job's time limit as appropriate due to delays powering up nodes.
 -- If sbatch is used to launch a job step within an existing allocation (as
    used by LSF) and the required node is powered down, print the message
    "Job step creation temporarily disabled, retrying", sleep, and retry.
 -- Configuration parameter ResumeDelay added to control how much time must 
    after a node has been suspended before resume it (e.g. powering it back 
    up).
 -- Fix CPU binding for batch program. Patch from Matthieu Hautreux, CEA.
 -- Fix for front end systems non-responding nodes now show up correctly in
    sinfo.

* Changes in SLURM 2.0.0-rc1
============================
 -- Fix bug in preservation of advanced reservations when slurmctld restarts.
 -- Updated perlapi to match correctly with slurm.h structures
 -- Do not install the srun command on BlueGene systems (mpirun must be used to
    launch tasks).
 -- Corrections to scheduling logic for topology/tree in configurations where 
    nodes are configured in multiple leaf switches.
 -- Patch from Matthieu Hautreux for backup mysql deamon support.
 -- Changed DbdBackup to DbdBackupHost for slurmdbd.conf file
 -- Add support for spank_strerror() function and improve error handling in
    general for SPANK plugins.
 -- Added configuration parameter SrunIOTimeout to optionally ping srun's tasks
    for better fault tolerance (e.g. killed and restarteed SLURM daemons on 
    compute node).
 -- Add slurmctld and slurmd binding to appropriate communications address
    based upon NodeAddr, ControllerAddr and BackupAddr configuration 
    parameters. Based upon patch from Matthieu Hautreux, CEA.
    NOTE: Fails when SlurmDBD is configured with some configurations.
    NOTE: You must define BIND_SPECIFIC_ADDR to enable this option.
 -- Avoid using powered down nodes when scheduling work if possible. 
    Fix possible invalid memory reference in power save logic.

* Changes in SLURM 1.4.0-pre13
==============================
 -- Added new partition option AllocNodes which controls the hosts from 
    which jobs can be submitted to this partition. From Matthieu Hautreux, CEA.
 -- Better support the --contiguous option for job allocations.
 -- Add new scontrol option: show topology (reports contents of topology.conf 
    file via RPC if topology/tree plugin is configured).
 -- Add advanced reservation display to smap command.
 -- Replaced remaining references to SLURM_JOBID with SLURM_JOB_ID - except
    when needed for backwards compatibility.
 -- Fix logic to properly excise a DOWN node from the allocation of a job
    with the --no-kill option.
 -- The MySQL and PgSQL plugins for accounting storage and job completion are
    now only built if the underlying database libraries exists (previously
    the plugins were built to produce a fatal error when used).
 -- BLUEGENE - scontrol show config will now display bluegene.conf information.

* Changes in SLURM 1.4.0-pre12
==============================
 -- Added support for hard time limit by associations with added configuration 
    option PriorityUsageResetPeriod. This specifies the interval at which to 
    clear the record of time used. This is currently only available with the 
    priority/multifactor plugin.
 -- Added SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR to sbatch's output environment variables.
 -- Backup slurmdbd support implemented.
 -- Update to checkpoint/xlch logic from Hongjia Cao, NUDT.
 -- Added configuration parameter AccountingStorageBackupHost.

* Changes in SLURM 1.4.0-pre11
==============================
 -- Fix slurm.spec file for RPM build.

* Changes in SLURM 1.4.0-pre10
==============================
 -- Critical bug fix in task/affinity when the CoresPerSocket is greater
    than the ThreadsPerCore (invalid memory reference).
 -- Add DebugFlag parameter of "Wiki" to log sched/wiki and wiki2 
    communications in greater detail.
 -- Add "-d <slurmstepd_path>" as an option to the slurmd daemon to
    specifying a non-stardard slurmstepd file, used  for testing purposes.
 -- Minor cleanup to crypto/munge plugin.
    - Restrict uid allowed to decode job credentials in crypto/munge
    - Get slurm user id early in crypto/munge
    - Remove buggy error code handling in crypto/munge
 -- Added sprio command - works only with the priority/multifactor plugin
 -- Add real topology plugin infrastructure (it was initially added 
    directly into slurmctld code). To specify topology information,
    set TopologyType=topology/tree and add configuration information
    to a new file called topology.conf. See "man topology.conf" or
    topology.html web page for details.
 -- Set "/proc/self/oom_adj" for slurmd and slurmstepd daemons based upon
    the values of SLURMD_OOM_ADJ and SLURMSTEPD_OOM_ADJ environment 
    variables. This can be used to prevent daemons being killed when
    a node's memory is exhausted. Based upon patch by Hongjia  Cao, NUDT.
 -- Fix several bugs in task/affinity: cpuset logic was broken and 
    --cpus-per-task option not properly handled.
 -- Ensure slurmctld adopts SlurmUser GID as well as UID on startup.

* Changes in SLURM 1.4.0-pre9
=============================
 -- OpenMPI users only: Add srun logic to automatically recreate and 
    re-launch a job step if the step fails with a reserved port conflict.
 -- Added TopologyPlugin configuration parameter.
 -- Added switch topology data structure to slurmctld (for use by select 
    plugin) add load it based upon new slurm.conf parameters: SwitchName, 
    Nodes, Switches and LinkSpeed.
 -- Modify select/linear and select/cons_res plugins to optimize resource
    allocation with respect to network topology.
 -- Added  support for new configuration parameter EpilogSlurmctld (executed 
    by slurmctld daemon).
 -- Added checkpoint/blcr plugin, SLURM now support job checkpoint/restart 
    using BLCR. Patch from Hongjia Cao, NUDT, China.
 -- Made a variety of new environment variables available to PrologSlurmctld
    and EpilogSlurmctld. See the "Prolog and Epilog Scripts" section of the 
    slurm.conf man page for details.
 -- NOTE: Cold-start (without preserving state) required for upgrade from 
    version 1.4.0-pre8.

* Changes in SLURM 1.4.0-pre8
=============================
 -- In order to create a new partition using the scontrol command, use
    the "create" option rather than "update" (which will only operate
    upon partitions that already exist).
 -- Added environment variable SLURM_RESTART_COUNT to batch jobs to
    indicated the count of job restarts made.
 -- Added sacctmgr command "show config".
 -- Added the scancel option --nodelist to cancel any jobs running on a
    given list of nodes.
 -- Add partition-specific DefaultTime (default time limit for jobs, 
    if not specified use MaxTime for the partition. Patch from Par
    Andersson, National Supercomputer Centre, Sweden.
 -- Add support for the scontrol command to be able change the Weight
    associated with nodes. Patch from Krishnakumar Ravi[KK] (HP).
 -- Add DebugFlag configuration option of "CPU_Bind" for detailed CPU
    binding information to be logged.
 -- Fix some significant bugs in task binding logic (possible infinite loops
    and memory corruption).
 -- Add new node state flag of NODE_STATE_MAINT indicating the node is in
    a reservation of type MAINT.
 -- Modified task/affinity plugin to automatically bind tasks to sockets,
    cores, or threads as appropriated based upon resource allocation and
    task count. User can override with srun's --cpu_bind option. 
 -- Fix bug in backfill logic for select/cons_res plugin, resulted in 
    error "cons_res:_rm_job_from_res: node_state mis-count".
 -- Add logic go bind a batch job to the resources allocated to that job.
 -- Add configuration parameter MpiParams for (future) OpenMPI port 
    management. Add resv_port_cnt and resv_ports fields to the job step 
    data structures. Add environment variable SLURM_STEP_RESV_PORTS to
    show what ports are reserved for a job step.
 -- Add support for SchedulerParameters=interval=<sec> to control the time
    interval between executions of the backfill scheduler logic.
 -- Preserve record of last job ID in use even when doing a cold-start unless
    there is no job state file or there is a change in its format (which only 
    happens when there is a change in SLURM's major or minor version number: 
    v1.3 -> v1.4).
 -- Added new configuration parameter KillOnBadExit to kill a job step as soon
    as any task of a job step exits with a non-zero exit code. Patch based
    on work from Eric Lin, Bull.
 -- Add spank plugin calls for use by salloc and sbatch command, see 
    "man spank" for details.
 -- NOTE: Cold-start (without preserving state) required for upgrade from 
    version 1.4.0-pre7.

* Changes in SLURM 1.4.0-pre7
=============================
 -- Bug fix for preemption with select/cons_res when there are no idle nodes.
 -- Bug fix for use of srun options --exclusive and --cpus-per-task together
    for job step resource allocation (tracking of cpus in use was bad).
 -- Added the srun option --preserve-env to pass the current values of 
    environment variables SLURM_NNODES and SLURM_NPROCS through to the 
    executable, rather than computing them from commandline parameters.
 -- For select/cons_res or sched/gang only: Validate a job's resource 
    allocation socket and core count on each allocated node. If the node's
    configuration has been changed, then abort the job.
 -- For select/cons_res or sched/gang only: Disable updating a node's 
    processor count if FastSchedule=0. Administrators must set a valid
    processor count although the memory and disk space configuration can
    be loaded from the compute node when it starts.
 -- Add configure option "--disable-iso8601" to disable SLURM use of ISO 8601
    time format at the time of SLURM build. Default output for all commands
    is now ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss).
 -- Add support for scontrol to explicity power a node up or down using the
    configured SuspendProg and ResumeProg programs.
 -- Fix book select/cons_res logic for tracking the number of allocated
    CPUs on a node when a partition's Shared value is YES or FORCE.
 -- Added configure options "--enable-cray-xt" and "--with-apbasil=PATH" for
    eventual support of Cray-XT systems.

* Changes in SLURM 1.4.0-pre6
=============================
 -- Fix job preemption when sched/gang and select/linear are configured with
    non-sharing partitions.
 -- In select/cons_res insure that required nodes have available resources.

* Changes in SLURM 1.4.0-pre5
=============================
 -- Correction in setting of SLURM_CPU_BIND environment variable.
 -- Rebuild slurmctld's job select_jobinfo->node_bitmap on restart/reconfigure
    of the daemon rather than restoring the bitmap since the nodes in a system
    can change (be added or removed).
 -- Add configuration option "--with-cpusetdir=PATH" for non-standard 
    locations.
 -- Get new multi-core data structures working on BlueGene systems.
 -- Modify PMI_Get_clique_ranks() to return an array of integers rather 
    than a char * to satisfy PMI standard. Correct logic in 
    PMI_Get_clique_size() for when srun --overcommit option is used.
 -- Fix bug in select/cons_res, allocated a job all of the processors on a 
    node when the --exclusive option is specified as a job submit option.
 -- Add NUMA cpu_bind support to the task affinity plugin. Binds tasks to
    a set of CPUs that belong NUMA locality domain with the appropriate
    --cpu-bind option (ldoms, rank_ldom, map_ldom, and mask_ldom), see
    "man srun" for more information.

* Changes in SLURM 1.4.0-pre4
=============================
 -- For task/affinity, force jobs to use a particular task binding by setting
    the TaskPluginParam configuration parameter rather than slurmd's
    SLURM_ENFORCED_CPU_BIND environment variable.
 -- Enable full preemption of jobs by partition with select/cons_res 
    (cons_res_preempt.patch from Chris Holmes, HP).
 -- Add configuration parameter DebugFlags to provide detailed logging for
    specific subsystems (steps and triggers so far).
 -- srun's --no-kill option is passed to slurmctld so that a job step is 
    killed even if the node where srun executes goes down (unless the 
    --no-kill option is used, previous termination logic would fail if 
    srun was not responding).
 -- Transfer a job step's core bitmap from the slurmctld to the slurmd
    within the job step credential.
 -- Add cpu_bind, cpu_bind_type, mem_bind and mem_bind_type to job allocation
    request and job_details structure in slurmctld. Add support to --cpu_bind
    and --mem_bind options from salloc and sbatch commands.

* Changes in SLURM 1.4.0-pre3
=============================
 -- Internal changes: CPUs per node changed from 32-bit to 16-bit size.
    Node count fields changed from 16-bit to 32-bit size in some structures.
 -- Remove select plugin functions select_p_get_extra_jobinfo(),
    select_p_step_begin() and select_p_step_fini().
 -- Remove the following slurmctld job structure fields: num_cpu_groups,
    cpus_per_node, cpu_count_reps, alloc_lps_cnt, alloc_lps, and used_lps.
    Use equivalent fields in new "select_job" structure, which is filled
    in by the select plugins.
 -- Modify mem_per_task in job step request from 16-bit to 32-bit size.
    Use new "select_job" structure for the job step's memory management.
 -- Add core_bitmap_job to slurmctld's job step structure to identify
    which specific cores are allocated to the step.
 -- Add new configuration option OverTimeLimit to permit jobs to exceed 
    their (soft) time limit by a configurable amount. Backfill scheduling
    will be based upon the soft time limit.
 -- Remove select_g_get_job_cores(). That data is now within the slurmctld's
    job structure.

* Changes in SLURM 1.4.0-pre2
=============================
 -- Remove srun's --ctrl-comm-ifhn-addr option (for PMI/MPICH2). It is no
    longer needed.
 -- Modify power save mode so that nodes can be powered off when idle. See
    https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/power_save.html or 
    "man slurm.conf" (SuspendProgram and related parameters) for more 
    information.
 -- Added configuration parameter PrologSlurmctld, which can be used to boot
    nodes into a particular state for each job. See "man slurm.conf" for 
    details.
 -- Add configuration parameter CompleteTime to control how long to wait for 
    a job's completion before allocating already released resources to pending
    jobs. This can be used to reduce fragmentation of resources. See
    "man slurm.conf" for details.
 -- Make default CryptoType=crypto/munge. OpenSSL is now completely optional.
 -- Make default AuthType=auth/munge rather than auth/none.
 -- Change output format of "sinfo -R" from "%35R %N" to "%50R %N".

* Changes in SLURM 1.4.0-pre1
=============================
 -- Save/restore a job's task_distribution option on slurmctld retart.
    NOTE: SLURM must be cold-started on converstion from version 1.3.x.
 -- Remove task_mem from job step credential (only job_mem is used now).
 -- Remove --task-mem and --job-mem options from salloc, sbatch and srun
    (use --mem-per-cpu or --mem instead).
 -- Remove DefMemPerTask from slurm.conf (use DefMemPerCPU or DefMemPerNode
    instead).
 -- Modify slurm_step_launch API call. Move launch host from function argument
    to element in the data structure slurm_step_launch_params_t, which is
    used as a function argument.
 -- Add state_reason_string to job state with optional details about why
    a job is pending.
 -- Make "scontrol show node" output match scontrol input for some fields
    ("Cores" changed to "CoresPerSocket", etc.).
 -- Add support for a new node state "FUTURE" in slurm.conf. These node records
    are created in SLURM tables for future use without a reboot of the SLURM
    daemons, but are not reported by any SLURM commands or APIs.

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.17
=========================
 -- Fix bug in configure script that can clear user specified LIBS.

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.16
=========================
 -- Fix memory leak in forward logic of tree message passing.
 -- Fix job exit code recorded for srun job allocation.
 -- Bluegene - Bug fix for too many parameters being passed to a debug statement
 -- Bluegene - Bug fix for systems running more than 8 in the X dim running
    Dynamic mode.

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.15
=========================
 -- Fix bug in squeue command with sort on job name ("-S j" option) for jobs
    that lack a name. Previously generated an invalid memory reference.
 -- Permit the TaskProlog to write to the job's standard output by writing
    a line containing the prefix "print " to it's standard output.
 -- Fix for making the slurmdbd agent thread start up correctly when 
    stopped and then started again.
 -- Add squeue option to report jobs by account (-U or --account). Patch from
    Par Andersson, National Supercomputer Centre, Sweden.
 -- Add -DNUMA_VERSION1_COMPATIBILITY to Makefile CFLAGS for proper behavior
    when building with NUMA version 2 APIs.
 -- BLUEGENE - slurm works on a BGP system.
 -- BLUEGENE - slurm handles HTC blocks
 -- BLUEGENE - Added option DenyPassthrough in the bluegene.conf.  Can be set
    to any combination of X,Y,Z to not allow passthroughs when running in 
    dynamic layout mode.
 -- Fix bug in logic to remove a job's dependency, could result in abort.
 -- Add new error message to sched/wiki and sched/wiki2 (Maui and Moab) for
    STARTJOB request: "TASKLIST includes non-responsive nodes".
 -- Fix bug in select/linear when used with sched/gang that can result in a 
    job's required or excluded node specification being ignored.
 -- Add logic to handle message connect timeouts (timed-out.patch from 
    Chuck Clouston, Bull).
 -- BLUEGENE - CFLAGS=-m64 is no longer required in configure
 -- Update python-hostlist code from Kent Engström (NSC) to v1.5
    - Add hostgrep utility to search for lines matching a hostlist.
    - Make each "-" on the command line count as one hostlist argument.
      If multiple hostslists are given on stdin they are combined to a
      union hostlist before being used in the way requested by the
      options.
 -- When using -j option in sacct no user restriction will applied unless
    specified with the -u option.
 -- For sched/wiki and sched/wiki2, change logging of wiki message traffic
    from debug() to debug2(). Only seen if SlurmctldDebug is configured to
    6 or higher.
 -- Significant speed up for association based reports in sreport
 -- BLUEGENE - fix for checking if job can run with downed nodes.  Previously 
    sbatch etc would tell you node configuration not available now jobs are 
    accepted but held until nodes are back up.
 -- Fix in accounting so if any nodes are removed from the system when they 
    were previously down will be recorded correctly.
 -- For sched/wiki2 (Moab), add flag to note if job is restartable and
    prevent deadlock of job requeue fails.
 -- Modify squeue to return non-zero exit code on failure. Patch from
    Par Andersson (NSC).
 -- Correct logic in select/cons_res to allocate a job the maximum node
    count from a range rather than minimum (e.g. "sbatch -N1-4 my.sh").
 -- In accounting_storage/filetxt and accounting_storage/pgsql fix 
    possible invalid memory reference when a job lacks a name.
 -- Give srun command an exit code of 1 if the prolog fails.
 -- BLUEGENE - allows for checking nodecard states in the system instead 
    of midplane state so as to not down an entire midplane if you don't 
    have to.
 -- BLUEGENE - fix creation of MESH blocks 
 -- BLUEGENE - on job cancellation we call jm_cancel_job and then wait until
    the system cleans up the job.  Before we would send a SIGKILL right 
    at the beginning. 
 -- BLUEGENE - if a user specifies a node count that can not be met the job 
    will be refused instead of before the plugin would search for the next 
    larger size that could be created.  This prevents users asking for 
    things that can't be created, and then getting something back they might 
    not be expecting.

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.14
=========================
 -- SECURITY BUG: Fix in sbcast logic that permits users to write files based
    upon supplimental groups of the slurmd daemon. Similar logic for event
    triggers if slurmctld is run as user root (not typical).

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.13
=========================
 -- Added ability for slurmdbd to archive and purge step and/or job records.
 -- Added DefaultQOS as an option to slurmdbd.conf for when clusters are 
    added the default will be set to this if none is given in the sacctmgr line.
 -- Added configure option --enable-sun-const for Sun Constellation system with
    3D torus interconnect. Supports proper smap and sview displays for 3-D
    topology. Node names are automatically put into Hilbert curve order given
    a one-line nodelist definition in slurm.conf (e.g. NodeNames=sun[000x533]). 
 -- Fixed bug in parsing time for sacct and sreport to pick the correct year if
    none is specified.
 -- Provide better scheduling with overlapping partitions (when a job can not
    be scheduled due to insufficient resources, reserve specific the nodes
    associated with that partition rather than blocking all partitions with
    any overlapping nodes).
 -- Correct logic to log in a job's stderr that it was "CANCELLED DUE TO 
    NODE FAILURE" rather than just "CANCELLED".
 -- Fix to crypto/openssl plugin that could result in job launch requests
    being spoofed through the use of an improperly formed credential. This bug 
    could permit a user to launch tasks on compute nodes not allocated for 
    their use, but will NOT permit them to run tasks as another user. For more 
    information see http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2008-016.html

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.12
=========================
 -- Added support for Workload Characteristic Key (WCKey) in accounting.  The
    WCkey is something that can be used in accounting to group associations
    together across clusters or within clusters that are not related.  Use 
    the --wckey option in srun, sbatch or salloc or set the SLURM_WCKEY env
    var to have this set. Use sreport with the wckey option to view reports.
    THIS CHANGES THE RPC LEVEL IN THE SLURMDBD.  YOU MUST UPGRADE YOUR SLURMDBD
    BEFORE YOU UPGRADE THE REST OF YOUR CLUSTERS.  THE NEW SLURMDBD WILL TALK 
    TO OLDER VERSIONS OF SLURM FINE.
 -- Added configuration parameter BatchStartTimeout to control how long to 
    allow for a batch job prolog and environment loading (for Moab) to run.
    Previously if job startup took too long, a batch job could be cancelled
    before fully starting with a SlurmctldLog message of "Master node lost 
    JobId=#, killing it".  See "man slurm.conf" for details.
 -- For a job step, add support for srun's --nodelist and --exclusive options
    to be used together.
 -- On slurmstepd failure, set node state to DRAIN rather than DOWN.
 -- Fix bug in select/cons_res that would incorrectly satify a tasks's
    --cpus-per-task specification by allocating the task CPUs on more than
    one node.
 -- Add support for hostlist expressions containing up to two numeric 
    expressions (e.g. "rack[0-15]_blade[0-41]").
 -- Fix bug in slurmd message forwarding which left file open in the case of
    some communication failures.
 -- Correction to sinfo node state information on BlueGene systems. DRAIN
    state was replaced with ALLOC or IDLE under some situations.
 -- For sched/wiki2 (Moab), strip quotes embedded within job names from the
    name reported.
 -- Fix bug in jobcomp/script that could cause the slurmctld daemon to exit
    upon reconfiguration ("scontrol reconfig" or SIGHUP).
 -- Fix to sinfo, don't print a node's memory size or tmp_disk space with 
    suffix of "K" or "M" (thousands or millions of megabytes).
 -- Improve efficiency of scheduling jobs into partitions which do not overlap.
 -- Fixed sreport user top report to only display the limit specified 
    instead of all users.

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.11
=========================
 -- Bluegene/P support added (minimally tested, but builds correctly).
 -- Fix infinite loop when using accounting_storage/mysql plugin either from
    the slurmctld or slurmdbd daemon.
 -- Added more thread safety for assoc_mgr in the controller.
 -- For sched/wiki2 (Moab), permit clearing of a job's dependencies with the 
    JOB_MODIFY option "DEPEND=0".
 -- Do not set a running or pending job's EndTime when changing it's time 
    limit.
 -- Fix bug in use of "include" parameter within the plugstack.conf file.
 -- Fix bug in the parsing of negative numeric values in configuration files.
 -- Propagate --cpus-per-task parameter from salloc or sbatch input line to
    the SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK environment variable in the spawned shell for 
    srun to use.
 -- Add support for srun --cpus-per-task=0. This can be used to spawn tasks
    without allocating resouces for the job step from the job's allocation
    when running multiple job steps with the --exclusive option.
 -- Remove registration messages from saved messages when bringing down cluster.
    Without causes deadlock if wrong cluster name is given.
 -- Correction to build for srun debugger (export symbols).
 -- sacct will now display more properly allocations made with salloc with only 
    one step.
 -- Altered sacctmgr, sreport to look at complete option before applying. 
    Before we would only look at the first determined significant characters.
 -- BLUGENE - in overlap mode marking a block to error state will now end
    jobs on overlapping blocks and free them.
 -- Give a batch job 20 minutes to start before considering it missing and 
    killing it (long delay could result from slurmd being paged out). Changed
    the log message from "Master node lost JobId=%u, killing it" to "Batch 
    JobId=%u missing from master node, killing it".
 -- Avoid "Invalid node id" error when a job step within an existing job 
    allocation specifies a node count which is less than the node count
    allocated in order to satisfy the task count specification (e.g. 
    "srun -n16 -N1 hostname" on allocation of 16 one-CPU nodes).
 -- For sched/wiki2 (Moab) disable changing a job's name after it has begun
    execution.

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.10
=========================
 -- Fix several bugs in the hostlist functions:
    - Fix hostset_insert_range() to do proper accounting of hl->nhosts (count).
    - Avoid assertion failure when callinsg hostset_create(NULL).
    - Fix return type of hostlist and hostset string functions from size_t to
      ssize_t.
    - Add check for NULL return from hostlist_create().
    - Rewrite of hostrange_hn_within(), avoids reporting "tst0" in the hostlist
      "tst".
 -- Modify squeue to accept "--nodes=<hostlist>" rather than 
    "--node=<node_name>" and report all jobs with any allocated nodes from set
    of nodes specified. From Par Anderson, National Supercomputer Centre, 
    Sweden.
 -- Fix bug preventing use of TotalView debugger with TaskProlog configured or 
    or srun's --task-prolog option.
 -- Improve reliability of batch job requeue logic in the event that the slurmd
    daemon is temporarily non-responsive (for longer than the configured
    MessageTimeout value but less than the SlurmdTimeout value).
 -- In sched/wiki2 (Moab) report a job's MAXNODES (maximum number of permitted
    nodes).
 -- Fixed SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE to live up more to it's name on an allocation. 
    Will now contain the number of tasks per node instead of the number of CPUs
    per node.  This is only for a resource allocation. Job steps already have 
    the environment variable set correctly.
 -- Configuration parameter PropagateResourceLimits has new option of "NONE".
 -- User's --propagate options take precidence over PropagateResourceLimits
    configuration parameter in both srun and sbatch commands.
 -- When Moab is in use (salloc or sbatch is executed with the --get-user-env
    option to be more specific), load the user's default resource limits rather
    than propagating the Moab daemon's limits.
 -- Fix bug in slurmctld restart logic for recovery of batch jobs that are
    initiated as a job step rather than an independent job (used for LSF).
 -- Fix bug that can cause slurmctld restart to fail, bug introduced in SLURM
    version 1.3.9. From Eygene Ryabinkin, Kurchatov Institute, Russia.
 -- Permit slurmd configuration parameters to be set to new values from 
    previously unset values.

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.9
========================
 -- Fix jobs being cancelled by ctrl-C to have correct cancelled state in 
    accounting.
 -- Slurmdbd will only cache user data, made for faster start up
 -- Improved support for job steps in FRONT_END systems
 -- Added support to dump and load association information in the controller
    on start up if slurmdbd is unresponsive
 -- BLUEGENE - Added support for sched/backfill plugin
 -- sched/backfill modified to initiate multiple jobs per cycle.
 -- Increase buffer size in srun to hold task list expressions. Critical 
    for jobs with 16k tasks or more.
 -- Added support for eligible jobs and downed nodes to be sent to accounting
    from the controller the first time accounting is turned on.
 -- Correct srun logic to support --tasks-per-node option without task count.
 -- Logic in place to handle multiple versions of RPCs within the slurmdbd. 
    THE SLURMDBD MUST BE UPGRADED TO THIS VERSION BEFORE UPGRADING THE 
    SLURMCTLD OR THEY WILL NOT TALK.  
    Older versions of the slurmctld will continue to talk to the new slurmdbd.
 -- Add support for new job dependency type: singleton. Only one job from a 
    given user with a given name will execute with this dependency type.
    From Matthieu Hautreux, CEA.
 -- Updated contribs/python/hostlist to version 1.3: See "CHANGES" file in
    that directory for details. From Kent Engström, NSC.
 -- Add SLURM_JOB_NAME environment variable for jobs submitted using sbatch.
    In order to prevent the job steps from all having the same name as the 
    batch job that spawned them, the SLURM_JOB_NAME environment variable is
    ignored when setting the name of a job step from within an existing 
    resource allocation.
 -- For use with sched/wiki2 (Moab only), set salloc's default shell based 
    upon the user who the job runs as rather than the user submitting the job 
    (user root).
 -- Fix to sched/backfill when job specifies no time limit and the partition
    time limit is INFINITE.
 -- Validate a job's constraints (node features) at job submit or modification 
    time. Major re-write of resource allocation logic to support more complex
    job feature requests.
 -- For sched/backfill, correct logic to support job constraint specification
    (e.g. node features).
 -- Correct power save logic to avoid trying to wake DOWN node. From Matthieu
    Hautreux, CEA.
 -- Cancel a job step when one of it's nodes goes DOWN based upon the job 
    step's --no-kill option, by default the step is killed (previously the 
    job step remained running even without the --no-kill option).
 -- Fix bug in logic to remove whitespace from plugstack.conf.
 -- Add new configuration parameter SallocDefaultCommand to control what 
    shell that salloc launches by default.
 -- When enforcing PrivateData configuration parameter, failures return 
    "Access/permission denied" rather than "Invalid user id".
 -- From sbatch and srun, if the --dependency option is specified then set 
    the environment variable SLURM_JOB_DEPENDENCY to the same value.
 -- In plugin jobcomp/filetxt, use ISO8601 formats for time by default (e.g. 
    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS rather than MM/DD-HH:MM:SS). This restores the default
    behavior from Slurm version 1.2. Change the value of USE_ISO8601 in
    src/plusings/jobcomp/filetxt/jobcomp_filetxt.c to revert the behavior.
 -- Add support for configuration option of ReturnToService=2, which will 
    return a DOWN to use if the node was previous set DOWN for any reason.
 -- Removed Gold accounting plugin.  This plugin was to be used for accounting 
    but has seen not been maintained and is no longer needed.  If using this
    please contact slurm-dev@llnl.gov.
 -- When not enforcing associations and running accounting if a user 
    submits a job to an account that does not have an association on the 
    cluster the account will be changed to the default account to help 
    avoid trash in the accounting system.  If the users default account 
    does not have an association on the cluster the requested account 
    will be used.
 -- Add configuration parameter "--have-front-end" to define HAVE_FRONT_END 
    in config.h and run slurmd only on a front end (suitable only for SLURM
    development and testing).

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.8
========================
 -- Added PrivateData flags for Users, Usage, and Accounts to Accounting. 
    If using slurmdbd, set in the slurmdbd.conf file. Otherwise set in the 
    slurm.conf file.  See "man slurm.conf" or "man slurmdbd.conf" for details.
 -- Reduce frequency of resending job kill RPCs. Helpful in the event of 
    network problems or down nodes.
 -- Fix memory leak caused under heavy load when running with select/cons_res
    plus sched/backfill.
 -- For salloc, if no local command is specified, execute the user's default
    shell.
 -- BLUEGENE - patch to make sure when starting a job blocks required to be
    freed are checked to make sure no job is running on them.  If one is found
    we will requeue the new job.  No job will be lost.
 -- BLUEGENE - Set MPI environment variables from salloc.
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix threading issue for overlap mode
 -- Reject batch scripts containing DOS linebreaks.
 -- BLUEGENE - Added wait for block boot to salloc

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.7
========================
 -- Add jobid/stepid to MESSAGE_TASK_EXIT to address race condition when 
    a job step is cancelled, another is started immediately (before the 
    first one completely terminates) and ports are reused. 
    NOTE: This change requires that SLURM be updated on all nodes of the
    cluster at the same time. There will be no impact upon currently running
    jobs (they will ignore the jobid/stepid at the end of the message).
 -- Added Python module to process hostslists as used by SLURM. See
    contribs/python/hostlist. Supplied by Kent Engstrom, National
    Supercomputer Centre, Sweden.
 -- Report task termination due to signal (restored functionality present
    in slurm v1.2).
 -- Remove sbatch test for script size being no larger than 64k bytes.
    The current limit is 4GB.
 -- Disable FastSchedule=0 use with SchedulerType=sched/gang. Node 
    configuration must be specified in slurm.conf for gang scheduling now.
 -- For sched/wiki and sched/wiki2 (Maui or Moab scheduler) disable the ability
    of a non-root user to change a job's comment field (used by Maui/Moab for
    storing scheduler state information).
 -- For sched/wiki (Maui) add pending job's future start time to the state
    info reported to Maui.
 -- Improve reliability of job requeue logic on node failure.
 -- Add logic to ping non-responsive nodes even if SlurmdTimeout=0. This permits
    the node to be returned to use when it starts responding rather than 
    remaining in a non-usable state.
 -- Honor HealthCheckInterval values that are smaller than SlurmdTimeout.
 -- For non-responding nodes, log them all on a single line with a hostlist 
    expression rather than one line per node. Frequency of log messages is 
    dependent upon SlurmctldDebug value from 300 seconds at SlurmctldDebug<=3
    to 1 second at SlurmctldDebug>=5.
 -- If a DOWN node is resumed, set its state to IDLE & NOT_RESPONDING and 
    ping the node immediately to clear the NOT_RESPONDING flag.
 -- Log that a job's time limit is reached, but don't sent SIGXCPU.
 -- Fixed gid to be set in slurmstepd when run by root
 -- Changed getpwent to getpwent_r in the slurmctld and slurmd
 -- Increase timeout on most slurmdbd communications to 60 secs (time for
    substantial database updates).
 -- Treat srun option of --begin= with a value of now without a numeric
    component as a failure (e.g. "--begin=now+hours").
 -- Eliminate a memory leak associated with notifying srun of allocated
    nodes having failed.
 -- Add scontrol shutdown option of "slurmctld" to just shutdown the 
    slurmctld daemon and leave the slurmd daemons running.
 -- Do not require JobCredentialPrivateKey or JobCredentialPublicCertificate
    in slurm.conf if using CryptoType=crypto/munge.
 -- Remove SPANK support from sbatch. 

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.6
========================
 -- Add new function to get information for a single job rather than always
    getting information for all jobs. Improved performance of some commands. 
    NOTE: This new RPC means that the slurmctld daemons should be updated
    before or at the same time as the compute nodes in order to process it.
 -- In salloc, sbatch, and srun replace --task-mem options with --mem-per-cpu
    (--task-mem will continue to be accepted for now, but is not documented).
    Replace DefMemPerTask and MaxMemPerTask with DefMemPerCPU, DefMemPerNode,
    MaxMemPerCPU and MaxMemPerNode in slurm.conf (old options still accepted
    for now, but mapped to "PerCPU" parameters and not documented). Allocate
    a job's memory memory at the same time that processors are allocated based
    upon the --mem or --mem-per-cpu option rather than when job steps are
    initiated.
 -- Altered QOS in accounting to be a list of admin defined states, an
    account or user can have multiple QOS's now.  They need to be defined using
    'sacctmgr add qos'.  They are no longer an enum.  If none are defined
    Normal will be the QOS for everything.  Right now this is only for use 
    with MOAB.  Does nothing outside of that.
 -- Added spank_get_item support for field S_STEP_CPUS_PER_TASK.
 -- Make corrections in spank_get_item for field S_JOB_NCPUS, previously 
    reported task count rather than CPU count.
 -- Convert configuration parameter PrivateData from on/off flag to have
    separate flags for job, partition, and node data. See "man slurm.conf"
    for details.
 -- Fix bug, failed to load DisableRootJobs configuration parameter.
 -- Altered sacctmgr to always return a non-zero exit code on error and send 
    error messages to stderr.

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.5
========================
 -- Fix processing of auth/munge authtentication key for messages originating 
    in slurmdbd and sent to slurmctld. 
 -- If srun is allocating resources (not within sbatch or salloc) and MaxWait
    is configured to a non-zero value then wait indefinitely for the resource
    allocation rather than aborting the request after MaxWait time.
 -- For Moab only: add logic to reap defunct "su" processes that are spawned by
    slurmd to load user's environment variables.
 -- Added more support for "dumping" account information to a flat file and 
    read in again to protect data incase something bad happens to the database.
 -- Sacct will now report account names for job steps.
 -- For AIX: Remove MP_POERESTART_ENV environment variable, disabling 
    poerestart command. User must explicitly set MP_POERESTART_ENV before 
    executing poerestart.
 -- Put back notification that a job has been allocated resources when it was
    pending.

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.4
========================
 -- Some updates to man page formatting from Gennaro Oliva, ICAR.
 -- Smarter loading of plugins (doesn't stat every file in the plugin dir)
 -- In sched/backfill avoid trying to schedule jobs on DOWN or DRAINED nodes.
 -- forward exit_code from step completion to slurmdbd
 -- Add retry logic to socket connect() call from client which can fail 
    when the slurmctld is under heavy load.
 -- Fixed bug when adding associations to add correctly.
 -- Added support for associations for user root.
 -- For Moab, sbatch --get-user-env option processed by slurmd daemon
    rather than the sbatch command itself to permit faster response
    for Moab.
 -- IMPORTANT FIX: This only effects use of select/cons_res when allocating
    resources by core or socket, not by CPU (default for SelectTypeParameter). 
    We are not saving a pending job's task distribution, so after restarting
    slurmctld, select/cons_res was over-allocating resources based upon an 
    invalid task distribution value. Since we can't save the value without 
    changing the state save file format, we'll just set it to the default 
    value for now and save it in Slurm v1.4. This may result in a slight 
    variation on how sockets and cores are allocated to jobs, but at least 
    resources will not be over-allocated.
 -- Correct logic in accumulating resources by node weight when more than 
    one job can run per node (select/cons_res or partition shared=yes|force).
 -- slurm.spec file updated to avoid creating empty RPMs. RPM now *must* be
    built with correct specification of which packages to build or not build.
    See the top of the slurm.spec file for information about how to control
    package building specification.
 -- Set SLURM_JOB_CPUS_PER_NODE for jobs allocated using the srun command.
    It was already set for salloc and sbatch commands.
 -- Fix to handle suspended jobs that were cancelled in accounting
 -- BLUEGENE - fix to only include bps given in a name from the bluegene.conf 
    file.
 -- For select/cons_res: Fix record-keeping for core allocations when more 
    than one partition uses a node or there is more than one socket per node.
 -- In output for "scontrol show job" change "StartTime" header to "EligibleTime"
    for pending jobs to accurately describe what is reported.
 -- Add more slurmdbd.conf paramters: ArchiveScript, ArchiveAge, JobPurge, and
    StepPurge (not fully implemented yet).
 -- Add slurm.conf parameter EnforcePartLimits to reject jobs which exceed a
    partition's size and/or time limits rather than leaving them queued for a
    later change in the partition's limits. NOTE: Not reported by
    "scontrol show config" to avoid changing RPCs. It will be reported in 
    SLURM version 1.4.
 -- Added idea of coordinator to accounting.  A coordinator can add associations
    between exsisting users to the account or any sub-account they are 
    coordinator to.  They can also add/remove other coordinators to those 
    accounts.
 -- Add support for Hostname and NodeHostname in slurm.conf being fully 
    qualified domain names (by Vijay Ramasubramanian, University of Maryland). 
    For more information see "man slurm.conf".

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.3
========================
 -- Add mpi_openmpi plugin to the main SLURM RPM.
 -- Prevent invalid memory reference when using srun's --cpu_bind=cores option
    (slurm-1.3.2-1.cea1.patch from Matthieu Hautreux, CEA).
 -- Task affinity plugin modified to support a particular cpu bind type: cores,
    sockets, threads, or none. Accomplished by setting an environment variable
    SLURM_ENFORCE_CPU_TYPE (slurm-1.3.2-1.cea2.patch from Matthieu Hautreux, 
    CEA).
 -- For BlueGene only, log "Prolog failure" once per job not once per node.
 -- Reopen slurmctld log file after reconfigure or SIGHUP is received.
 -- In TaskPlugin=task/affinity, fix possible infinite loop for slurmd.
 -- Accounting rollup works for mysql plugin.  Automatic rollup when using 
    slurmdbd.
 -- Copied job stat logic out of sacct into sstat in the future sacct -stat 
    will be deprecated.
 -- Correct sbatch processing of --nice option with negative values.
 -- Add squeue formatted print option %Q to print a job's integer priority.
 -- In sched/backfill, fix bug that was changing a pending job's shared value
    to zero (possibly changing a pending job's resource requirements from a 
    processor on some node to the full node).

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.2
========================
 -- Get --ntasks-per-node option working for sbatch command.
 -- BLUEGENE: Added logic to give back a best block on overlapped mode 
    in test_only mode
 -- BLUEGENE: Updated debug info and man pages for better help with the 
    numpsets option and to fail correctly with bad image request for building
    blocks.
 -- In sched/wiki and sched/wiki2 properly support Slurm license consumption
    (job state reported as "Hold" when required licenses are not available).
 -- In sched/wiki2 JobWillRun command, don't return an error code if the job(s)
    can not be started at that time. Just return an error message (from 
    Doug Wightman, CRI).
 -- Fix bug if sched/wiki or sched/wiki2 are configured and no job comment is 
    set.
 -- scontrol modified to report partition partition's "DisableRootJobs" value.
 -- Fix bug in setting host address for PMI communications (mpich2 only).
 -- Fix for memory size accounting on some architectures.
 -- In sbatch and salloc, change --dependency's one letter option from "-d"
    to "-P" (continue to accept "-d", but change the documentation).
 -- Only check that task_epilog and task_prolog are runable by the job's
    user, not as root.
 -- In sbatch, if specifying an alternate directory (--workdir/-D), then
    input, output and error files are in that directory rather than the 
    directory from which the command is executed
 -- NOTE: Fully operational with Moab version 5.2.3+. Change SUBMITCMD in
    moab.cfg to be the location of sbatch rather than srun. Also set 
    HostFormat=2 in SLURM's wiki.conf for improved performance.
 -- NOTE: We needed to change an RPC from version 1.3.1. You must upgrade 
    all nodes in a cluster from v1.3.1 to v1.3.2 at the same time.
 -- Postgres plugin will work from job accounting, not for association 
    management yet.
 -- For srun/sbatch --get-user-env option (Moab use only) look for "env"
    command in both /bin and /usr/sbin (for Suse Linux).
 -- Fix bug in processing job feature requests with node counts (could fail
    to schedule job if some nodes have not associated features).
 -- Added nodecnt and gid to jobcomp/script
 -- Insure that nodes select in "srun --will-run" command or the equivalent in
    sched/wiki2 are in the job's partition.
 -- BLUGENE - changed partition Min|MaxNodes to represent c-node counts
    instead of base partitions
 -- In sched/gang only, prevent possible invalid memory reference when 
    slurmctld is reconfigured, e.g. "scontrol reconfig".
 -- In select/linear only, prevent invalid memory reference in log message when
    nodes are added to slurm.conf and then "scontrol reconfig" is executed. 

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.1
========================
 -- Correct logic for processing batch job's memory limit enforcement.
 -- Fix bug that was setting a job's requeue value on any update of the 
    job using the "scontrol update" command. The invalid value of an 
    updated job prevents it's recovery when slurmctld restarts.
 -- Add support for cluster-wide consumable resources. See "Licenses"
    parameter in slurm.conf man page and "--licenses" option in salloc, 
    sbatch and srun man pages.
 -- Major changes in select/cons_res to support FastSchedule=2 with more
    resources configured than actually exist (useful for testing purposes).
 -- Modify srun --test-only response to include expected initiation time 
    for a job as well as the nodes to be allocated and processor count
    (for use by Moab).
 -- Correct sched/backfill to properly honor job dependencies.
 -- Correct select/cons_res logic to allocate CPUs properly if there is
    more than one thread per core (previously failed to allocate all cores).
 -- Correct select/linear logic in shared job count (was off by 1).
 -- Add support for job preeption based upon partition priority (in sched/gang,
    preempt.patch from Chris Holmes, HP).
 -- Added much better logic for mysql accounting.  
 -- Finished all basic functionality for sacctmgr.
 -- Added load file logic to sacctmgr for setting up a cluster in one step.
 -- NOTE: We needed to change an RPC from version 1.3.0. You must upgrade 
    all nodes in a cluster from v1.3.0 to v1.3.1 at the same time.
 -- NOTE: Work is currently underway to improve placement of jobs for gang
    scheduling and preemption.
 -- NOTE: Work is underway to provide additional tools for reporting 
    accounting information.

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.0
========================
 -- In sched/wiki2, add processor count to JOBWILLRUN response.
 -- Add event trigger for node entering DRAINED state.
 -- Build properly without OpenSSL installed (OpenSSL is recommended, but not 
    required).
 -- Added slurmdbd, and modified accounting_storage plugin to talk to it. 
    Allowing multiple slurm systems to securly store and gather information
    not only about jobs, but the system also. See accounting web page for more
    information.    

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.0-pre11
==============================
 -- Restructure the sbcast RPC to take advantage of larger buffers available
    in Slurm v1.3 RPCs.
 -- Fix several memory leaks.
 -- In scontrol, show job's Requeue value, permit change of Requeue and Comment
    values.
 -- In slurmctld job record, add QOS (quality of service) value for accounting
    purposes with Maui and Moab.
 -- Log to a job's stderr when it is being cancelled explicitly or upon reaching
    it's time limit.
 -- Only permit a job's account to be changed while that job is PENDING.
 -- Fix race condition in job suspend/resume (slurmd.sus_res.patch from HP).

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.0-pre10
==============================
 -- Add support for node-specific "arch" (architecture) and "os" (operating 
    system) fields. These fields are set based upon values reported by the
    slurmd daemon on each compute node using SLURM_ARCH and SLURM_OS environment 
    variables (if set, the uname function otherwise) and are intended to support
    changes in real time changes in operating system. These values are reported
    by "scontrol show node" plus the sched/wiki and sched/wiki2 plugins for Maui
    and Moab respectively.
 -- In sched/wiki and sched/wiki2: add HostFormat and HidePartitionJobs to 
    "scontrol show config" SCHEDULER_CONF output.
 -- In sched/wiki2: accept hostname expression as input for GETNODES command.
 -- Add JobRequeue configuration parameter and --requeue option to the sbatch
    command.
 -- Add HealthCheckInterval and HealthCheckProgram configuration parameters.
 -- Add SlurmDbdAddr, SlurmDbdAuthInfo and SlurmDbdPort configuration parameters.
 -- Modify select/linear to achieve better load leveling with gang scheduler.
 -- Develop the sched/gang plugin to support select/linear and
    select/cons_res. If sched/gang is enabled and Shared=FORCE is configured
    for a partition, this plugin will gang-schedule or "timeslice" jobs that
    share common resources within the partition. Note that resources that are
    shared across partitions are not gang-scheduled.
 -- Add EpilogMsgTime configuration parameter. See "man slurm.conf" for details.
 -- Increase default MaxJobCount configuration parameter from 2000 to 5000. 
 -- Move all database common files from src/common to new lib in src/database.
 -- Move sacct to src/accounting added sacctmgr for scontrol like operations 
    to accounting infrastructure.
 -- Basic functions of sacctmgr in place to make for administration of 
    accounting.
 -- Moved clusteracct_storage plugin to accounting_storage plugin,
    jobacct_storage is still it's own plugin for now.
 -- Added template for slurm php extention.
 -- Add infrastructure to support allocation of cluster-wide licenses to jobs.
    Full support will be added some time after version 1.3.0 is released.
 -- In sched/wiki2 with select/bluegene, add support for WILLRUN command
    to accept multiple jobs with start time specifications.

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.0-pre9
=============================
 -- Add spank support to sbatch. Note that spank_local_user() will be called 
    with step_layout=NULL and gid=SLURM_BATCH_SCRIPT and spank_fini() will 
    be called immediately afterwards.
 -- Made configure use mysql_config to find location of mysql database install
    Removed bluegene specific information from the general database tables.
 -- Re-write sched/backfill to utilize new will-run logic in the select 
    plugins. It now supports select/cons_res and all job options (required
    nodes, excluded nodes, contiguous, etc.).
 -- Modify scheduling logic to better support overlapping partitions.
 -- Add --task-mem option and remove --job-mem option from srun, salloc, and 
    sbatch commands. Enforce step memory limit, if specified and there is
    no job memory limit specified (--mem). Also see DefMemPerTask and
    MaxMemPerTask in "man slurm.conf". Enforcement is dependent upon job
    accounting being enabled with non-zero value for JoabAcctGatherFrequency.
 -- Change default node tmp_disk size to zero (for diskless nodes).

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.0-pre8
=============================
 -- Modify how strings are packed in the RPCs, Maximum string size 
    increased from 64KB (16-bit size field) to 4GB (32-bit size field).
 -- Fix bug that prevented time value of "INFINITE" from being processed.
 -- Added new srun/sbatch option "--open-mode" to control how output/error 
    files are opened ("t" for truncate, "a" for append).
 -- Added checkpoint/xlch plugin for use with XLCH (Hongjia Cao, NUDT).
 -- Added srun option --checkpoint-path for use with XLCH (Hongjia Cao, NUDT).
 -- Added new srun/salloc/sbatch option "--acctg-freq" for user control over 
    accounting data collection polling interval.
 -- In sched/wiki2 add support for hostlist expression use in GETNODES command
    with HostFormat=2 in the wiki.conf file.
 -- Added new scontrol option "setdebug" that can change the slurmctld daemons
    debug level at any time (Hongjia Cao, NUDT).
 -- Track total total suspend time for jobs and steps for accounting purposes.
 -- Add version information to partition state file.
 -- Added 'will-run' functionality to all of the select plugins (bluegene,
    linear, and cons_res) to return node list and time job can start based 
    on other jobs running.
 -- Major restructuring of node selection logic. select/linear now supports
    partition max_share parameter and tries to match like size jobs on the 
    same nodes to improve gang scheduling performance. Also supports treating 
    memory as consumable resource for job preemption and  gang scheduling if 
    SelectTypeParameter=CR_Memory in slurm.conf.
 -- BLUEGENE: Reorganized bluegene plugin for maintainability sake.
 -- Major restructuring of data structures in select/cons_res.
 -- Support job, node and partition names of arbitrary size.
 -- Fix bug that caused slurmd to hang when using select/linear with
    task/affinity.

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.0-pre7
=============================
 -- Fix a bug in the processing of srun's --exclusive option for a job step.

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.0-pre6
=============================
 -- Add support for configurable number of jobs to share resources using the 
    partition Shared parameter in slurm.conf (e.g. "Shared=FORCE:3" for two 
    jobs to share the resources). From Chris Holmes, HP.
 -- Made salloc use api instead of local code for message handling.

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.0-pre5
=============================
 -- Add select_g_reconfigure() function to node changes in slurmctld configuration
    that can impact node scheduling.
 -- scontrol to set/get partition's MaxTime and job's Timelimit in minutes plus
    new formats: min:sec, hr:min:sec, days-hr:min:sec, days-hr, etc.
 -- scontrol "notify" command added to send message to stdout of srun for 
    specified job id.
 -- For BlueGene, make alpha part of node location specification be case insensitive.
 -- Report scheduler-plugin specific configuration information with the 
    "scontrol show configuration" command on the SCHEDULER_CONF line. This
    information is not found in the "slurm.conf" file, but a scheduler plugin 
    specific configuration (e.g. "wiki.conf").
 -- sview partition information reported now includes partition priority.
 -- Expand job dependency specification to support concurrent execution, 
    testing of job exit status and multiple job IDs.

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.0-pre4
=============================
 -- Job step launch in srun is now done from the slurm api's all further
    modifications to job launch should be done there.
 -- Add new partition configuration parameter Priority. Add job count to 
    Shared parameter.
 -- Add new configuration parameters DefMemPerTask, MaxMemPerTask, and 
    SchedulerTimeSlice.
 -- In sched/wiki2, return REJMESSAGE with details on why a job was 
    requeued (e.g. what node failed).

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.0-pre3
=============================
 -- Remove slaunch command
 -- Added srun option "--checkpoint=time" for job step to automatically be 
    checkpointed on a period basis.
 -- Change behavior of "scancel -s KILL <jobid>" to send SIGKILL to all job
    steps rather than cancelling the job. This now matches the behavior of
    all other signals. "scancel <jobid>" still cancels the job and all steps.
 -- Add support for new job step options --exclusive and --immediate. Permit
    job steps to be queued when resources are not available within an existing 
    job allocation to dedicate the resources to the job step. Useful for
    executing simultaneous job steps. Provides resource management both at 
    the level of jobs and job steps.
 -- Add support for feature count in job constraints, for example
    srun --nodes=16 --constraint=graphics*4 ...
    Based upon work by Kumar Krishna (HP, India).
 -- Add multi-core options to salloc and sbatch commands (sbatch.patch and
    cleanup.patch from Chris Holmes, HP).
 -- In select/cons_res properly release resources allocated to job being 
    suspended (rmbreak.patch, from Chris Holmes, HP).
 -- Removed database and jobacct plugin replaced with jobacct_storage 
    and jobacct_gather for easier hooks for further expansion of the
    jobacct plugin.

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.0-pre2
=============================
 -- Added new srun option --pty to start job with pseudo terminal attached 
    to task 0 (all other tasks have I/O discarded)
 -- Disable user specifying jobid when sched/wiki2 configured (needed for 
    Moab releases until early 2007).
 -- Report command, args and working directory for batch jobs with 
    "scontrol show job".

* Changes in SLURM 1.3.0-pre1
=============================
 -- !!! SRUN CHANGES !!!
    The srun options -A/--allocate, -b/--batch, and -a/--attach have been
    removed!  That functionality is now available in the separate commands
    salloc, sbatch, and sattach, respectively.
 -- Add new node state FAILING plus trigger for when node enters that state.
 -- Add new configuration paramter "PrivateData". This can be used to 
    prevent a user from seeing jobs or job steps belonging to other users.
 -- Added configuration parameters for node power save mode: ResumeProgram
    ResumeRate, SuspendExcNodes, SuspendExcParts, SuspendProgram and 
    SuspendRate.
 -- Slurmctld maintains the IP address (rather than hostname) for srun 
    communications. This fixes some possible network routing issues.
 -- Added global database plugin.  Job accounting and Job completion are the 
    first to use it.  Follow documentation to add more to the plugin.
 -- Removed no-longer-needed jobacct/common/common_slurmctld.c since that is
    replaced by the database plugin.
 -- Added new configuration parameter: CryptoType.
    Moved existing digital signature logic into new plugin: crypto/openssl.
    Added new support for crypto/munge (available with GPL license).

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.36
=========================
 -- For spank_get_item(S_JOB_ARGV) for batch job with script input via STDIN,
    set argc value to 1 (rather than 2, argv[0] still set to path of generated
    script).
 -- sacct will now display more properly allocations made with salloc with only 
    one step.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.35
=========================
 -- Permit SPANK plugins to dynamically register options at runtime base upon
    configuration or other runtime checks.
 -- Add "include" keywork to SPANK plugstack.conf file to optionally include
    other configuration files or directories of configuration files.
 -- Srun to wait indefinitely for resource allocation to be made. Used to
    abort after two minutes.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.34
=========================
 -- Permit the cancellation of a job that is in the process of being 
    requeued.
 -- Ignore the show_flag when getting job, step, node or partition information
    for user root.
 -- Convert some functions to thread-safe versions: getpwnam, getpwuid, 
    getgrnam, and getgrgid to similar functions with "_r" suffix. While no
    failures have been observed, a race condition would in the worst case
    permit a user access to a partition not normally allowed due to the
    AllowGroup specification or the wrong user identified in an accounting
    record. The job would NOT be run as the wrong user.
 -- For PMI only (MPICH2/MVAPICH2) base address to send messages to (the srun)
    upon the address from which slurmd gets the task launch request rather then
    "hostname" where srun executes.
 -- Make test for StateSaveLocation directory more comprehensive.
 -- For jobcomp/script plugin, PROCS environment variable is now the actual
    count of allocated processors rather than the count of processes to 
    be started.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.33
=========================
 -- Cancelled or Failed jobs will now report their job and step id on exit
 -- Add SPANK items available to get: SLURM_VERSION, SLURM_VERSION_MAJOR,
    SLURM_VERISON_MINOR and SLURM_VERSION_MICRO.
 -- Fixed handling of SIGPIPE in srun. Abort job.
 -- Fix bug introduced to MVAPICH plugin preventing use of TotalView debugger.
 -- Modify slurmctld to get srun/salloc network address based upon the incoming
    message rather than hostname set by the user command (backport of logic in
    SLURM v1.3).

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.32
=========================
 -- LSF only: Enable scancel of job in RootOnly partition by the job's owner.
 -- Add support for sbatch --distribution and --network options.
 -- Correct pending job's wait reason to "Priority" rather than "Resources" if
    required resources are being held in reserve for a higher priority job.
 -- In sched/wiki2 (Moab) report a node's state as "Drained" rather than 
    "Draining" if it has no allocated work (An undocumented Moab wiki option, 
    see CRI ticket #2394).
 -- Log to job's output when it is cancelled or reaches it's time limit (ported
    from existing code in slurm v1.3).
 -- Add support in salloc and sbatch commands for --network option.
 -- Add support for user environment variables that include '\n' (e.g. 
    bash functions).
 -- Partial rewrite of mpi/mvapich plugin for improved scalability.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.31
=========================
 -- For Moab only: If GetEnvTimeout=0 in slurm.conf then do not run "su" to get
    the user's environment, only use the cache file.
 -- For sched/wiki2 (Moab), treat the lack of a wiki.conf file or the lack 
    of a configured AuthKey as a fatal error (lacks effective security).
 -- For sched/wiki and sched/wiki2 (Maui or Moab) report a node's state as 
    Busy rather than Running when allocated if SelectType=select/linear. Moab
    was trying to schedule job's on nodes that were already allocated to jobs
    that were hidden from it via the HidePartitionJobs in Slurm's wiki.conf.
 -- In select/cons_res improve the resource selection when a job has specified
    a processor count along with a maximum node count.
 -- For an srun command with --ntasks-per-node option and *no* --ntasks count,
    spawn a task count equal to the number of nodes selected multiplied by the 
    --ntasks-per-node value.
 -- In jobcomp/script: Set TZ if set in slurmctld's environment.
 -- In srun with --verbose option properly format CPU allocation information 
    logged for clusters with 1000+ nodes and 10+ CPUs per node.
 -- Process a job's --mail_type=end option on any type of job termination, not
    just normal completion (e.g. all failure modes too).

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.30
=========================
 -- Fix for gold not to print out 720 error messages since they are
    potentally harmful.
 -- In sched/wiki2 (Moab), permit changes to a pending job's required features:
    CMD=CHANGEJOB ARG=<jobid> RFEATURES=<features>
 -- Fix for not aborting when node selection doesn't load, fatal error instead
 -- In sched/wiki and sched/wiki2 DO NOT report a job's state as "Hold" if it's
    dependencies have not been satisfied. This reverses a changed made in SLURM
    version 1.2.29 (which was requested by Cluster Resources, but places jobs 
    in a HELD state indefinitely).

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.29
=========================
 -- Modified global configuration option "DisableRootJobs" from number (0 or 1)
    to boolean (YES or NO) to match partition parameter.
 -- Set "DisableRootJobs" for a partition to match the global parameters value 
    for newly created partitions.
 -- In sched/wiki and sched/wiki2 report a node's updated features if changed
    after startup using "scontrol update ..." command.
 -- In sched/wiki and sched/wiki2 report a job's state as "Hold" if it's 
    dependencies have not been satisfied.
 -- In sched/wiki and sched/wiki2 do not process incoming requests until
    slurm configuration is completely loaded.
 -- In sched/wiki and sched/wiki2 do not report a job's node count after it 
    has completed (slurm decrements the allocated node count when the nodes
    transition from completing to idle state).
 -- If job prolog or epilog fail, log the program's exit code.
 -- In jobacct/gold map job names containing any non-alphanumeric characters 
    to '_' to avoid MySQL parsing problems.
 -- In jobacct/linux correct parsing if command name contains spaces.
 -- In sched/wiki and sched/wiki2 report make job info TASK count reflect the 
    actual task allocation (not requested tasks) even after job terminates.
    Useful for accounting purposes only.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.28
=========================
 -- Added configuration option "DisableRootJobs" for parameter 
    "PartitionName".  See "man slurm.conf" for details.
 -- Fix for faking a large system to correctly handle node_id in the task
    afffinity plugin for ia64 systems.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.27
=========================
 -- Record job eligible time in accounting database (for jobacct/gold only).
 -- Prevent user root from executing a job step within a job allocation 
    belonging to another user.
 -- Fixed limiting issue for strings larger than 4096 in xstrfmtcat
 -- Fix bug in how Slurm reports job state to Maui/Moab when a job is requeued
    due to a node failure, but we can't terminate the job's spawned processes.
    Job was being reported as PENDING when it was really still COMPLETING.
 -- Added patch from Jerry Smith for qstat -a output
 -- Fixed looking at the correct perl path for Slurm.pm in torque wrappers.
 -- Enhance job requeue on node failure to be more robust.
 -- Added configuration parameter "DisableRootJobs". See "man slurm.conf" 
    for details.
 -- Fixed issue with account = NULL in Gold job accounting plugin

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.26
=========================
 -- Correct number of sockets/cores/threads reported by slurmd (from
    Par Andersson, National Supercomputer Centre, Sweden).
 -- Update libpmi linking so that libslurm is not required for PMI use
    (from Steven McDougal, SiCortex).
 -- In srun and sbatch, do not check the PATH env var if an absolute pathname 
    of the program is specified (previously reported an error if no PATH).
 -- Correct output of "sinfo -o %C" (CPU counts by node state).

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.25
=========================
 -- Bug fix for setting exit code in accounting for batch script.
 -- Add salloc option, --no-shell (for LSF).
 -- Added new options for sacct output
 -- mvapich: Ensure MPIRUN_ID is unique for all job steps within a job.
    (Fixes crashes when running multiple job steps within a job on one node)
 -- Prevent "scontrol show job" from failing with buffer overflow when a job 
    has a very long Comment field.
 -- Make certain that a job step is purged when a job has been completed.
    Previous versions could have the job step persist if an allocated node
    went DOWN and the slurmctld restarted.
 -- Fix bug in sbcast that can cause communication problems for large files.
 -- Add sbcast option -t/--timeout and SBCAST_TIMEOUT environment variable 
    to control message timeout.
 -- Add threaded agent to manage a queue of Gold update requests for 
    performance reasons.
 -- Add salloc options --chdir and --get-user-env (for Moab).
 -- Modify scontrol update to support job comment changes.
 -- Do not clear a DRAINED node's reason field when slurmctld restarts.
 -- Do not cancel a pending job if Moab or Maui try to start it on unusable nodes.
    Leave the job queued.
 -- Add --requeue option to srun and sbatch (these undocumented options have no
    effect in slurm v1.2, but are legitimate options in slurm v1.3).
 
* Changes in SLURM 1.2.24
=========================
 -- In sched/wiki and sched/wiki2, support non-zero UPDATE_TIME specification
    for GETNODES and GETJOBS commands.
 -- Bug fix for sending accounting information multiple times for same 
    info.  patch from Hongjia Cao (NUDT).
 -- BLUEGENE - try FILE pointer rotation logic to avoid core dump on 
    bridge log rotate
 -- Spread out in time the EPILOG_COMPLETE messages from slurmd to slurmctld
    to avoid message congestions and retransmission.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.23
=========================
 -- Fix for libpmi to not export unneeded variables like xstr*
 -- BLUEGENE - added per partition dynamic block creation
 -- fix infinite loop bug in sview when there were multiple partitions
 -- Send message to srun command when a job is requeued due to node failure.
    Note this will be overwritten in the output file unless JobFileAppend
    is set in slurm.conf. In slurm version 1.3, srun's --open-mode=append
    option will offer this control for each job.
 -- Change a node's default TmpDisk from 1MB to 0MB and change job's default 
    disk space requirement from 1MB to 0MB.
 -- In sched/wiki (Maui scheduler) specify a QOS (quality of service) by 
    specifying an account of the form "qos-name".
 -- In select/linear, fix bug in scheduling required nodes that already have
    a job running on them (req.load.patch from Chris Holmes, HP).
 -- For use with Moab only: change timeout for srun/sbatch --get-user-env 
    option to 2 secs, don't get DISPLAY environment variables, but explicitly 
    set ENVIRONMENT=BATCH and HOSTNAME to the execution host of the batch script.
 -- Add configuration parameter GetEnvTimeout for use with Moab. See
    "man slurm.conf" for details.
 -- Modify salloc and sbatch to accept both "--tasks" and "--ntasks" as 
    equivalent options for compatibility with srun.
 -- If a partition's node list contains space separators, replace them with 
    commas for easier parsing.
 -- BLUEGENE - fixed bug in geometry specs when creating a block.
 -- Add support for Moab and Maui to start jobs with select/cons_res plugin
    and jobs requiring more than one CPU per task.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.22
=========================
 -- In sched/wiki2, add support for MODIFYJOB option "MINSTARTTIME=<time>"
    to modify a job's earliest start time.
 -- In sbcast, fix bug with large files and causing sbcast to die.
 -- In sched/wiki2, add support for COMMENT= option in STARTJOB and CANCELJOB
    commands.
 -- Avoid printing negative job run time in squeue due to clock skew.
 -- In sched/wiki and sched/wiki2, add support for wiki.conf option
    HidePartitionJobs (see man pages for details).
 -- Update to srun/sbatch --get-user-env option logic (needed by Moab).
 -- In slurmctld (for Moab) added job->details->reserved_resources field
    to report resources that were kept in reserve for job while it was 
    pending.
 -- In sched/wiki (for Maui scheduler) report a pending job's node feature 
    requirements (from Miguel Roa, BSC).
 -- Permit a user to change a pending job's TasksPerNode specification 
    using scontrol (from Miguel Roa, BSC).
 -- Add support for node UP/DOWN event logging in jobacct/gold plugin
    WARNING: using the jobacct/gold plugin slows the system startup set the
    MessageTimeout variable in the slurm.conf to around 20+.
 -- Added check at start of slurmctld to look for /tmp/slurm_gold_first if
    there, and using the gold plugin slurm will make record of all nodes in
    downed or drained state.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.21
=========================
 -- Fixed torque wrappers to look in the correct spot for the perl api
 -- Do not treat user resetting his time limit to the current value as
    an error.
 -- Set correct executable names for Totalview when --multi-prog option 
    is used and more than one node is allocated to the job step.
 -- When a batch job gets requeued, record in accounting logs that 
    the job was cancelled, the requeued job's submit time will be 
    set to the time of its requeue so it looks like a different job.
 -- Prevent communication problems if the slurmd/slurmstepd have a 
    different JobAcct plugin configured than slurmctld.
 -- Adding Gold plugin for job accounting
 -- In sched/wiki2, add support for MODIFYJOB option "JOBNAME=<name>"
    to modify a job's name.
 -- Add configuration check for sys/syslog.h and include it as needed.
 -- Add --propagate option to sbatch for control over limit propagation.
 -- Added Gold interface to the jobacct plugin.  To configure in the config
    file specify...  
    JobAcctType=jobacct/gold
    JobAcctLogFile=CLUSTER_NAME:GOLD_AUTH_KEY_FILE:GOLDD_HOST:GOLDD_PORT7112
 -- In slurmctld job record, set begin_time to time when all of a job's
    dependencies are met.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.20
=========================
 -- In switch/federation, fix small memory leak effecting slurmd.
 -- Add PMI_FANOUT_OFF_HOST environment variable to control how message 
    forwarding is done for PMI (MPICH2). See "man srun" for details.
 -- From sbatch set SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE when --ntasks-per-node option is 
    specified.
 -- BLUEGENE: Documented the prefix should always be lower case and the 3
    digit suffix should be uppercase if any letters are used as digits. 
 -- In sched/wiki and sched/wiki2, add support for --cpus-per-task option.
    From Miguel Ros, BSC.
 -- In sched/wiki2, prevent invalid memory pointer (and likely seg fault) 
    for job associated with a partition that has since been deleted.
 -- In sched/wiki2 plus select/cons_res, prevent invalid memory pointer 
    (and likely seg fault) when a job is requeued.
 -- In sched/wiki, add support for job suspend, resume, and modify.
 -- In sched/wiki, add suppport for processor allocation (not just node allocation)
    with layout control.
 -- Prevent re-sending job termination RPC to a node that has already completed 
    the job. Only send it to specific nodes which have not reported completion.
 -- Support larger environment variables 64K instead of BUFSIZ (8k on some 
    systems).
 -- If a job is being requeued, job step create requests will print a 
    warning and repeatedly retry rather than aborting.
 -- Add optional mode value to srun and sbatch --get-user-env option.
 -- Print error message and retry job submit commands when MaxJobCount 
    is reached. From Don Albert, Bull.
 -- Treat invalid begin time specification as a fatal error in sbatch and 
    srun. From Don Albert, Bull.
 -- Validate begin time specification to avoid hours >24, minutes >59, etc.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.19
=========================
*** NOTE IMPORTANT CHANGE IN RPM BUILD BELOW ****
 -- slurm.spec file (used to build RPMs) was updated in order to support Mock, a
    chroot build environment. See https://hosted.fedoraproject.org/projects/mock/
    for more information. The following RPMs are no longer build by default:
    aix-federation, auth_none, authd, bluegene, sgijob, and switch-elan. Change 
    the RPMs built using the following options in ~/rpmmacros: "%_with_authd 1", 
    "%_without_munge 1", etc. See the slurm.spec file for more details.
 -- Print warning if non-privileged user requests negative "--nice" value on
    job submission (srun, salloc, and sbatch commands).
 -- In sched/wiki and sched/wiki2, add support for srun's --ntasks-per-node 
    option.
 -- In select/bluegene with Groups defined for Images, fix possible memory 
    corruption. Other configurations are not affected. 
 -- BLUEGENE - Fix bug that prevented user specification of linux-image, 
    mloader-image, and ramdisk-image on job submission.
 -- BLUEGENE - filter Groups specified for image not just by submitting 
    user's current group, but all groups the user has access to.
 -- BLUEGENE - Add salloc options to specify images to be loaded (--blrts-image, 
    --linux-image, --mloader-image, and --ramdisk-image).
 -- BLUEGENE - In bluegene.conf, permit Groups to be comma separated in addition 
    to colon separators previously supported.
 -- sbatch will accept batch script containing "#SLURM" options and advise
    changed to "#SBATCH".
 -- If srun --output or --error specification contains a task number rather 
    than a file name, send stdout/err from specified task to srun's stdout/err
    rather than to a file by the same name as the task's number.
 -- For srun --multi-prog option, verify configuration file before attempting 
    to launch tasks, report clear explanation of any configuration file errors.
 -- For sched/wiki2, add optional timeout option to srun's --get-user-env
    parameter, change default timeout for "su - <user> env" from 3 to 8 seconds.
    On timeout, attempt to load env from file at StateSaveLocation/env_cache/<user>.
    The format of this file is the same as output of "env" command. If there
    is no env cache file, then abort the request.
 -- squeue modified for completing job to remove nodes that have already 
    completed the job before applying node filter logic.
 -- squeue formatted output option added for job comment, "%q" (the obvious 
    choices for letters are already in use).
 -- Added configure option --enable-load-env-no-login for use with Moab. If
    set then the user job runs with the environment built without a login
    ("su <user> env" rather than "su - <user> env").
 -- Fix output of "srun -o %C" (allocated CPU count) for running jobs. This was
    broken in 1.2.18 for handling requeue of Moab jobs.
 -- Added logic to mpiexec wrapper to read in the MPIEXEC_TIMEOUT var
 -- Updated qstat wrapper to display information for partitions (-Q) option
 -- NOTE: SLURM should now work directly with Globus using the PBS GRAM.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.18
=========================
 -- BLUEGENE - bug fix for smap stating passthroughs are used when they aren't
 -- Fixed bug in sview to be able to edit partitions correctly

    work correctly.
 -- In sched/wiki2 and sched/wiki add support for batch job being requeued
    in Slurm either when nodes fail or upon request.
 -- In sched/wiki2 and sched/wiki with FastSchedule=2 configured and nodes 
    configured with more CPUs than actually exist, return a value of TASKS 
    equal to the number of configured CPUs that are allocated to a job rather 
    than the number of physical CPUs allocated.
 -- For sched/wiki2, timeout "srun --get-user-env ..." command after 3 seconds 
    if unable to perform pseudo-login and get user environment variables.
 -- Add contribs/time_login.c program to test how long pseudo-login takes
    for specific users or all users. This can identify users for which Moab 
    job submissions are unable to set the proper environment variables.
 -- Fix problem in parallel make of Slurm.
 -- Fixed bug in consumable resources when CR_Core_Memory is enabled
 -- Add delay in slurmctld for "scontrol shutdown" RPC to get propagated 
    to slurmd daemons.

 -- Add srun support for SLURM_THREADS and PMI_FANOUT environment variables.
 -- Fix support in squeue for output format with left justification of 
    reason (%r) and reason/node_list (%R) output.
 -- Automatically requeue a batch job when a node allocated to it fails
    or the prolog fails (unless --no-requeue or --no-kill option used).
 -- In sched/wiki, enable use of wiki.conf parameter ExcludePartitions to
    directly schedule selected partitions without Maui control.
 -- In sched/backfill, if a job requires specific nodes, schedule other jobs
    ahead of it rather than completely stopping backfill scheduling for that
    partition.
 -- BLUEGENE - corrected logic making block allocation work in a circular 
    fashion instead of linear.
 
* Changes in SLURM 1.2.16
=========================
 -- Add --overcommit option to the salloc command.
 -- Run task epilog from job's working directory rather than directory
    where slurmd daemon started from.

 -- In sched/wiki2, fix bug processing condensed hostlist expressions.
 -- Release contribs/mpich1.slurm.patch without GPL license. 
 -- Fix bug in mvapich plugin for read/write calls that return EAGAIN.
 -- Don't start MVAPICH timeout logic until we know that srun is starting 
    an MVAPICH program.
 -- Fix to srun only allocating number of nodes needed for requested task
    count when combining allocation and step creation in srun.

    by Chris Holmes, HP).
 -- Added PMI_TIME environment variable for user to control how PMI 
    communications are spread out in time. See "man srun" for details.
 -- Added PMI timing information to srun debug mode to aid in tuning.
    Use "srun -vv ..." to see the information.
 -- Added checkpoint/ompi (OpenMPI) plugin (still under development).

    from the user when excluding nodes, to avoid an error message.
 -- Disable salloc, sbatch and srun -I/--immediate options with 
    Moab scheduler.
 -- Added "contribs" directory with a Perl API and Torque wrappers for Torque 
    to SLURM migration.  This directory should be used to put anything that 
    is outside of SLURM proper such as a different API. Perl APIs contributed 
    by Hongjia Cao (NUDT).
 -- In sched/wiki2: add support for tasklist with node name expressions 
    and task counts (e.g. TASKLIST=tux[1-4]*2:tux[12-14]*4").
 -- In select/cons_res with sched/wiki2: fix bug in task layout logic.
 -- Removed all curses info from the bluegene plugin putting it into smap
    where it belongs.

    hour:min:sec, and days-hour:min:sec (formerly only supported minutes).
    Applies to salloc, sbatch, and srun commands.
 -- Improve scheduling support for exclusive constraint list, nodes can 
    now be in more than one constraint specific exclusively for a job
    (e.g. "srun -C [rack1|rack2|rack3|rowB] srun")
 -- Create separate MPICH/MX plugin (split out from MPICH/GM plugin)
 -- Increase default MessageTimeout (in slurm.conf) from 5 to 10 secs.
 -- Fix bug in batch job requeue if node zero of allocation fails to respond 
    to task launch request.
 -- Improve load leveling logic to more evenly distribute the workload 
    (best_load.patch, contributed by Chris Holmes, HP).
 
* Changes in SLURM 1.2.12
=========================
 -- Increase maximum message size from 1MB to 16MB (from Ernest Artiaga, BSC). 
 -- In PMI_Abort(), log the event and abort the entire job step.
 -- Add support for additional PMI functions: PMI_Get_clique_ranks and 
    PMI_Get_clique_size (from Chuck Clouston, Bull).
 -- Report an error when a hostlist comes in appearing to be a box but not 
    formatted in XYZxXYZ format.
 -- Add support for partition configuration "Shared=exclusive". This is 
    equivalent to "srun --exclusive" when select/cons_res is configured.
 -- In sched/wiki2, report the reason for a node being unavailable for the 
    GETNODES command using the CAT="<reason>" field.
 -- In sched/wiki2 with select/linear, duplicate hostnames in HOSTLIST, one
    per allocated processor.
 -- Fix bug in scancel with specific signal and job lacks active steps.
 -- In sched/wiki2, add support for NOTIFYJOB ARG=<jobid> MSG=<message>.
    This sends a message to an active srun command.
 -- salloc will now set SLURM_NPROCS to improve srun's behavior under salloc.
 -- In sched/wiki2 and select/cons_res: insure that Slurm's CPU allocation
    is identical to Moab's (from Ernest Artiaga and Asier Roa, BSC).
 -- Added "scontrol show slurmd" command to status local slurmd daemon.
 -- Set node DOWN if prolog fails on node zero of batch job launch.
 -- Properly handle "srun --cpus-per-task" within a job allocation when 
    SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE environment varable is not set.

 -- Enable nice file propagation from sbatch command.
 
* Changes in SLURM 1.2.11
=========================
 -- Updated "etc/mpich1.slurm.patch" for direct srun launch of MPICH1_P4
    tasks. See the "README" portion of the patch for details.
 -- Added new scontrol command "show hostlist <hostnames>" to translate a list 
    of hostnames into a hostlist expression (e.g. "tux1,tux2" -> "tux[1-2]")
    and "show hostnames <list>", returns a list of of nodes (one node per line)
    from SLURM hostlist expression or from SLURM_NODELIST environment variable 
    if no hostlist specified.
 -- Add the sbatch option "--wrap".
 -- Add the sbatch option "--get-user-env".

 -- Use SLURM_UMASK environment variable (if set) at job submit time as umask 
    for spawned job.
 -- Correct some format issues in the man pages (from Gennero Oliva, ICAR).
 -- Added support for parallel make across an existing SLURM allocation
    based upon GNU make-3.81. Patch is in "etc/make.slurm.patch".
 -- Added '-b' option to sbatch for easy MOAB trasition to sbatch instead of
    srun.  Option does nothing in sbatch.
 -- Changed wiki2's handling of a node state in Completing to return 'busy' 
    instead of 'running' which matches slurm version 1.1

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.10
=========================
 -- Fix race condititon in jobacct/linux with use of proctrack/pgid and a
    realloc issue inside proctrack/linux
 -- Added MPICH1_P4 plugin for direct launch of mpich1/p4 tasks using srun
    and a patched version of the mpi library. See "etc/mpich1.slurm.patch".
    NOTE: This is still under development and not ready for production use.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.9
========================
 -- Add new sinfo field to sort by "%E" sorts by the time associated with a 
    node's state (from Prashanth Tamraparni, HP).
 -- In sched/wiki: fix logic for restarting backup slurmctld.
 -- Preload SLURM plugins early in the slurmstepd operation to avoid
    multiple dlopens after forking (and to avoid a glibc bug
    that leaves dlopen locks in a bad state after a fork).
 -- Added MPICH1_P4 patch to launch tasks using srun rather than rsh and
    automatically generate mpirun's machinefile based upon the job's 
    allocation.    See "etc/mpich1.slurm.patch".
 -- BLUEGENE - fix for overlap mode to mark all other base partitions as used
    when creating a new block from the file to insure we only use the base 
    partitions we are asking for.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.8
========================
 -- Added mpi/mpich1_shmem plugin.

    preventing timely clean-up of batch jobs in some cases.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.7
========================
 -- BLUEGENE - code to make it so you can make a 36x36x36 system.  
    The wiring should be correct for a system with x-dim of 1,2,4,5,8,13
    in emulation mode.  It will work with any real system no matter the size.
 -- Major re-write of jobcomp/script plugin: fix memory leak and 
    general code clean-up.

 -- In forward logic fix to check if the forwarding node recieves a connection
    but doesn't ever get the message from the sender (network issue or
    something) also check to make sure if we get something back we make sure
    we account for everything we sent out before we call it good.
 -- Another fix to make sure steps with requested nodes have correct cpus
    accounted for and a fix to make sure the user can't allocate more 
    cpus than the have requested.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.3
========================
 -- Cpuset logic added to  task/affinity, from Don Albert (Bull) and
    Moe Jette (LLNL).  The /dev/cpuset file system must be mounted and 
    set "TaskPluginParam=cpusets" in slurm.conf to enable.
 -- In sched/wiki2, fix possible overflow in job's nodelist, from 
    Ernest Artiaga, BSC.
 -- Defer creation of new job steps until a suspended job is resumed.
 -- In select/linear - fix for potential stack corruption bug.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.2

    and SLURM_TASK_EPILOG. patch.1.2.0-pre11.070201.envproepilog from 
    Dan Palermo, HP.
 -- Documenation update. patch.1.2.0-pre11.070201.mchtml from Dan Palermo, HP.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.0-pre15
==============================
 -- Fix for another spot where the backup controller calls switch/federation
    code before switch/federation is initialized.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.0-pre14
==============================
 -- In sched/wiki2, clear required nodes list when a job is requeued.
    Note that the required node list is set to every node used when 
    a job is started via sched/wiki2.
 -- BLUEGENE - Added display of deallocating blocks to smap and other tools. 
 -- Make slurmctld's working directory be same as SlurmctldLogFile (if any),
    otherwise StateSaveDir (which is likely a shared directory, possibly 
    making core file identification more difficult).
 -- Fix bug in switch/federation that results in the backup controller
    aborting if it receives an epilog-complete message.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.0-pre13
==============================
 -- Fix for --get-user-env.

    state on real systems and total block config on emulation systems.
 -- Major update to Slurm's PMI internal logic for better scalability.
    Communications now supported directly between application tasks via 
    Slurm's PMI library. Srun sends single message to one task on each node
    and that tasks forwards key-pairs to other tasks on that nodes. The old 
    code sent key-pairs directly to each task. 
    NOTE: PMI applications must re-link with this new library.
 -- For multi-core support: Fix task distribution bug and add automated 
    tests, patch.1.2.0-pre11.070111.plane from Dan Palermo (HP).

==============================
 -- Add multi-core options to slurm_step_launch API.
 -- Add man pages for slurm_step_launch() and related functions.
 -- Jobacct plugin only looks at the proctrack list instead of the entire
    list of processes running on the node. Cutting down a lot of unnecessary
    file opens in linux and cutting down the time to query the procs by
    more than half.
 -- Multi-core bug fix, mask re-use with multiple job steps,
    patch.1.2.0-pre10.061214.affinity_stepid from Dan Palermo (HP).
 -- Modify jobacct/linux plugin to completely eliminate open /proc files.
 -- Added slurm_sched_plugin_reconfig() function to re-read config files.
 -- BLUEGENE - --reboot option to srun, salloc, and sbatch actually works.
 -- Modified step context and step launch APIs.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.0-pre10
==============================
 -- Fix for sinfo node state counts by state (%A and %F output options).
 -- Add ability to change a node's features via "scontrol update". NOTE: 
    Update slurm.conf also to preserve changes over slurmctld restart or 
    reconfig.
    NOTE: Job and node state information can not be preserved from earlier 
          versions.
 -- Added new slurm.conf parameter TaskPluginParam.
 -- Fix for job requeue and credential revoke logic from Hongjia Cao (NUDT).
 -- Fix for incorrectly generated masks for task/affinity plugin,
    patch.1.2.0-pre9.061207.bitfmthex from Dan Palermo (HP).
 -- Make mask_cpu options of srun and slaunch commands not requeue prefix
    of "0x". patch.1.2.0-pre9.061208.srun_maskparse from Dan Palermo (HP).
 -- Add -c support to the -B automatic mask generation for multi-core 
    support, patch.1.2.0-pre9.061208.mcore_cpuspertask from Dan Palermo (HP).
 -- Fix bug in MASK_CPU calculation, 
    patch.1.2.0-pre9.061211.avail_cpuspertask from Dan Palermo (HP).
 -- BLUEGENE - Added --reboot option to srun, salloc, and sbatch commands.
 -- Add "scontrol listpids [JOBID[.STEPID]]" support.
 -- Multi-core support patches, fixed SEGV and clean up output for large 
    task counts, patch.1.2.0-pre9.061212.cpubind_verbose from Dan Palermo (HP).
 -- Make sure jobacct plugin files are closed before exec of user tasks to 
    prevent problems with job checkpoint/restart (based on work by 
    Hongjia Cao, NUDT).

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.0-pre9
=============================
 -- Fix for select/cons_res state preservation over slurmctld restart,
    patch.1.2.0-pre7.061130.cr_state from Dan Palermo.
 -- Validate product of socket*core*thread count on node registration rather 
    than individual values. Correct values will need to be specified in slurm.conf 
    with FastSchedule=1 for correct multi-core scheduling behavior.

* Changes in SLURM 1.2.0-pre8
=============================
 -- Modity job state "reason" field to report why a job failed (previously 
    previously reported only reason waiting to run). Requires cold-start of 
    slurmctld (-c option).
 -- For sched/wiki2 job state request, return REJMESSAGE= with reason for 
    a job's failure.
 -- New FastSchedule configuration parameter option "2" means to base 
    scheduling decisions upon the node's configuration as specified in 
    slurm.conf and ignore the node's actual hardware configuration. This 
    can be useful for testing. 
 -- Add sinfo output format option "%C" for CPUs (active/idle/other/total).
    Based upon work by Anne-Marie Wunderlin (BULL).
 -- Assorted multi-core bug fixes (patch1.2.0-pre7.061128.mcorefixes).
 -- Report SelectTypeParameters from "scontrol show config".
 -- Build sched/wiki plugin for Maui Scheduler (based upon new sched/wiki2

    MPI support.
 -- Plug a bunch of memory leaks in various places.
 -- Bluegene - before assigning a job to a block the plugin will check the bps
    to make sure they aren't in error state.
 -- Change time format in job completion logging (JobCompType=jobcomp/filetxt)
    from "MM/DD HH:MM:SS" to "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS", conforming with the ISO8601 
    standard format.
 
* Changes in SLURM 1.1.0-pre6
=============================
 -- Added logic to "stat" a running job with sacct option -S use -j to specify
    job.step 
 -- removed jobacct/bluegene (no real need for this) meaning, I don't think 
    there is a way to gather the data yet.
 -- Added support for mapping "%h" in configured SlurmdLog to the hostname.
 -- Add PropagatePrioProcess to control propagation of a user's nice value 
    to spawned tasks (based upon work by Daniel Christians, HP).
 
* Changes in SLURM 1.1.0-pre5
=============================
 -- Added step completion RPC logic
 -- Vastly changed sacct and the jobacct plugin.  Read documentation for full
    details.
 -- Added jobacct plugin for AIX and BlueGene, they currently don't work, 
    but infrastructure is in place.
 -- Add support for srun option --ctrl-comm-ifhn to set PMI communications
    address (Hongjia Cao, National University of Defense Technology).
 -- Moved safe_read/write to slurm_protocol_defs.h removing multiple copies.
 -- Remove vestigial functions slurm_allocate_resources_and_run() and 
    slurm_free_resource_allocation_and_run_response_msg().
 -- Added support for different executable files and arguments by task based
    upon a configuration file. See srun's --multi-prog option (based upon 
    work by Hongjia Cao, National University of Defense Technology).
 -- moved the way forward logic waited for fanout logic mostly eliminating 
    problems with scalability issues.
 -- changed -l option in sacct to display different params see sacct/sacct.h
    for details.

* Changes in SLURM 1.1.0-pre4
=============================
 -- Bluegene specific - Added support to set bluegene block state to 
    free/error via scontrol update BlockName 
 -- Add needed symbol to select/bluegene in order to load plugin.

* Changes in SLURM 1.1.0-pre3
=============================
 -- Added framework for XCPU job launch support.
 -- New general configuration file parser and slurm.conf handling code.
    Allows long lines to be continued on the next line by ending with a "\".
    Whitespace is allowed between the key and "=", and between the "=" and
    value.
    WARNING: A NodeName may now occur only once in a slurm.conf file.
             If you want to temporarily make nodes DOWN in the slurm.conf,
             use the new DownNodes keyword (see "man slurm.conf").
 -- Gracefully handle request to submit batch job from within an existing 
    batch job.
 -- Warn user attempting to create a job allocation from within an existing job
    allocation.
 -- Add web page description for proctrack plugin.

    new system types. 
    WARNING: "JobAcctType=jobacct/log" is no longer supported.
 -- Removed vestigal 'bg' names from bluegene plugin and smap
 -- InactiveLimit parameter is not enforced for RootOnly partitions.
 -- Update select/cons_res web page (Susanne Balle, HP, 
    cons_res_doc_patch_3_29_06).
 -- Build a "slurmd.test" along with slurmd. slurmd.test has the path to 
    slurmstepd set allowing it to run unmodified out of the builddir for 
    testing (Mark Grondona).
 
* Changes in SLURM 1.1.0-pre2
=============================
 -- Added "bcast" command to transmit copies of a file to compute nodes
    with message fanout.
 -- Bluegene specific - Added support for overlapping partitions and 
    dynamic partitioning. 
 -- Bluegene specific - Added support for nodecard sized blocks.

    This logic is through display tools such as smap, sinfo, scontrol, and 
    squeue.
 -- Added bluegene.conf man page.
 -- Added support for memory affinity, see srun --mem_bind option.
 
* Changes in SLURM 1.1.0-pre1
=============================
 -- New --enable-multiple-slurmd configure parameter to allow running
    more than one copy of slurmd on a node at the same time.  Only
    really useful for developers.
 -- New communication is now branched on all processes to slurmd's from 
    slurmctld and srun launch command.  This is done with a tree type 
    algorithm.  Spawn and batch mode work the same as before.  New slurm.conf
    variable TreeWidth=50 is default.  This is the number of threads per 
    stop on the tree.  
 -- Configuration parameter HeartBeatInterval is depracated. Now used half
    of SlurmdTimeout and SlurmctldTimeout for communications to slurmd and
    slurmctld daemons repsectively.
 -- Add hash tables for select/cons_res plugin (Susanne Balle, HP, 
    patch_02222006).
 -- Remove some use of cr_enabled flag in slurmctld job record, use 
    new flag "test_only" in select_g_job_test() instead.

=========================
 -- For "srun --attach=X" to other users job, report an error and exit (it
    previously just hung).
 -- Make sure that "scancel -s KILL" terminates the job just like "scancel" 
    including deletion of all job steps (Chris Holmes, HP, slurm,patch).
 -- Recognize ISO-8859 input to srun as a script (for non-English scripts).
 -- switch/elan: Fix bug in propagation of ELAN_STATKEY environment variable.
 -- Fix bug in slurmstepd IO code that can result in it spinning if a
    certain error occurs.
 -- Remove nodes from srun's required node list if their count exceeds 
    the number of requested tasks.
 -- sched/backfill to schedule around jobs that are hung in a completing 
    state.
 -- Avoid possibly re-running the epilog for a job on slurmctld restart or 
    reconfig by saving and restoring a hostlist of nodes still completing 
    the job.

* Changes in SLURM 1.0.15
=========================
 -- In srun, reset stdin to blocking mode (if it was originally blocking before
    we set it to O_NONBLOCK) on exit to avoid trouble with things like running
    srun under a bash shell in an emacs *shell* buffer.
 -- Fix srun race condition that occasionally causes segfaults at shutdown
 -- Fix obscure locking issues in log.c code.
 -- Explicitly close IO related sockets.  If an srun gets "stuck", possibly
    because of unkillable tasks in its job step, it will not hold many TCP
    sockets in the CLOSE_WAIT state.
 -- Increase the SLURM protocol timeout from 5 seconds to 10 seconds.
    (In 1.2 there will be a slurm.conf parameter for this, rather than having
    it hardcoded.)

* Changes in SLURM 1.0.14
=========================
 -- Fix for bad xfree() call in auth/munge which can raise an assert().

    contain all users in group by adding the uids of the names in /etc/passwd
    that have a gid of that which we are looking for.
 -- Fix bug in InactiveLimit support that can potentially purge active jobs.
    NOTE: This is highly unlikely except on very large AIX clusters.
 -- Fix bug for reiniting the config_lock around the control_file in 
    slurm_protocol_api.c logic has changed in 1.1 so no need to merge
 
* Changes in SLURM 1.0.12
=========================
 -- Report node state of DRAIN rather than DOWN if DOWN with DRAIN flag set.

 -- Fix for stalled task stdout/stderr when buffered I/O is used, and
    a single line exceeds 4096 bytes.
 -- Memory leak fixes for maui plugin (hjcao@nudt.edu.cn)
 -- Fix for spinning srun when the terminal to which srun is talking
    goes away.

=========================
 -- Fix for slurmstepd hang when launching a task. (Needed to install
    list library's atfork handlers).
 -- Fix memory leak on AIX (and possibly other architectures) due to

 -- Fix "scontrol show config" to display JobCredentialPrivateKey instead
    of JobCredPrivateKey and JobCredentialPublicCertificate instead of
    JobCredPublicKey.  They now match the options in the slurm.conf.
 -- Fix bug in job accounting for very long node list records (Andy Riebs,
    HP, sacct_buf.patch).
 -- BLUEGENE SPECIFIC - added load function to smap to load an already 
    exsistant bluegene.conf file.
 -- Fix bug in sacct: If user requests specific job or job step ID,
    only the last one with that ID will be reported. If multiple 
    nodes fail, the job has its state recorded as "JOB_TERMINATED...nf"

 -- Removes the slurmd's use of SysV shared memory.  Instead the slurmd
    communicates with the slurmstepd processes through the slurmstepd's
    new named unix domain socket.  The "stepd_api" is used to talk to the
    slurmstepd (src/slurmd/common/stepd_api.[ch]).
 -- Bluegene specific - bluegene block allocator will find most any 
    partition size now.  Added support to start at any point in smap 
    to request a partition instead of always starting at 000.
 -- Bluegene specific - Support to smap to down or bring up nodes in 
    configure mode.  Added commands include allup, alldown, 
    up [range], down [range]
 -- Time format in sinfo/squeue/smap/sacct changed from D:HH:MM:SS to 
    D-HH:MM:SS per POSIX standards document.

    simple messaging protocol.
 -- Added task plugin and use task prolog/epilog(s).
 -- New slurmd_step functionality added.  Fork exec instead of using shared
    memory.  Not completely tested.
 -- BGL small partition logic in place in plugin and smap.  Scheduler needs  
    to be rewritten to handle multiple partitions on a single node. No 
    documentation written on process yet.
 -- If running select/bluegene plugin without access to BGL DB2, then 
    full-system bglblock is of system size defined in bluegene.conf.

=========================
 -- Fix bug in sinfo partition sorting order.
 -- Fix bugs in srun use of #SLURM options in batch script.

=============================
 -- Remove debugging xassert in switch/federation that were accidentally
    committed
 -- Make slurmd step manager retry slurm_container_destroy() indefinitely

    an argument.
 -- Modify smap so it shows all nodes and partitions by default (even 
    nodes that the user can't access, otherwise there are holes in 
    its maps).

    shell when using --allocate, -A.
 -- Modify  srun --uid=user and --gid=group options to maintain invoking 
    user's credentials until after nodes have been allocated to requested 
    user/group (allows root to run jobs and allocate nodes for other users 
    in a RootOnly partition).
 -- Fix node processing if state change requested via scontrol prior to 
    initial node registration.
 
* Changes in SLURM 0.3.0
========================
 -- Support for AIX added (a few bugs do remain).
 -- Fix memory leak in slurmctld, slurm_cred_create().
 -- On ELF systems, export BNR_* functions from SLURM API. 
 -- Add support for "hidden" partitions (applies to their 
    nodes, jobs, and job steps as well). APIs and commands 
    modified to optionally display hidden partitions.
 -- Modify partition's group_allow test to be based upon the user 
    of the allocation rather than the user making the allocation 
    request (user root for LCRM batch jobs).
 -- Restructure plugin directory structure.
 -- New --core=type option in srun for lightweight corefile support.
    (requires liblwcf).
 -- Let user root and SlurmUser exceed any partition limits.
 -- Srun treats "--time=0" as a request for an infinite time limit.
 
* Changes in SLURM 0.3.0.0-pre10
================================
 -- Fix bugs in support of slurmctld "-f" option (specify different 
    slurm.conf pathname).
 -- Remove slurmd "-f" option.
 -- Several documenation changes for slurm administrators.
 -- On ELF systems, export only slurm_* functions from slurm API and 
    ensure plugins use only slurm_ prefixed functions (created aliases
    where necessary).

 -- Fix bug in slurmctld's building of nodelist for job (failed if 
    more than one numeric field in node name).
 -- Change "scontrol completing" and "sinfo" to use job's node bitmap
    to identify nodes associated with that particular job that are 
    still processing job completion. This will work properly for 
    shared nodes.
 -- Set SLURM_DISTRIBUTION environment varible for user tasks.
 -- Fix for file descriptor leak in slurmd.
 -- Propagate stacksize limit to jobs along with other resource limits
    that were previously ignored.

* Changes in SLURM 0.3.0.0-pre9

    scalability.
 -- New sinfo option "--list-reason" or "-R". Displays down or drained 
    nodes along with their REASON field.

* Changes in SLURM 0.3.0.0-pre8
===============================
 -- Queue outgoing message traffic rather than immediately spawning 
    pthreads (under heavy load this resulted in hundreds of pthreads 
    using more memory than was available).
 -- Restructure slurmctld message agent for higher throughput.
 -- Add new sinfo options --responding and --dead (i.e. non-responding)
    for filtering node states.

   - slurm/381: Hold jobs requesting more resources than partition limit.
   - slurm/387: Jobs lost and nodes DOWN on slurmctld restart.
 -- Add support for getting node's real memory size on AIX.
 -- Sinfo sort partitions in slurm.conf order, new sort option ("#P").
 -- Document how to gracefully change plugin values.
 -- Slurmctld does not attempt to recover jobs when the switch plugin
    value changes (decision reached when any job's switch state recovery
    fails).
 -- Node does not transition from COMPLETING to DOWN state due to
    not responding. Wait for tasks to complete or admin to set DOWN.
 -- Always chmod SlurmdSpoolDir to 755 (a umask of 007 was resulting 
    in batch jobs failing).
 -- Return errors when trying to change configuration parameters
    AuthType, SchedulerType, and SwitchType via "scontrol reconfig"
    or SIGHUP. Document how to safely change these parameters.
 -- Plugin-specific error number definitions and descriptive strings 
    moved from common into plugin modules.

 -- Added -q,--quit-on-interrupt option to srun.
 -- Elan switch plugin now starts neterr resolver thread on all Elan3
    systems (QsNet and QsNetII).
 -- Added some missing read locks for references for slurmctld's 
    configuration data structure

===============================
 -- Fixes for reported problems:
   - slurm/372: job state descriptions added to squeue man page

    to ignore SIGTERM)
 -- Sinfo "--exact" option only applies to fields actually displayed
 -- Partition processor count not correctly computed for heterogeneous 
    clusters with FastSchedule=0 configuration
 -- Only return DOWN nodes to service if the reason for them being in 
    that state is non-responsiveness and "ReturnToService=1" configuration
 -- Partition processor count now correctly computed for heterogeneous 
    clusters with FastSchedule configured off
 -- New macros and function to export SLURM version number

     losing track of jobs
   - slurm/329: Job processing may be left running when one task dies
   - slurm/333: Slurmd fails to launch a job and deletes a step, due to 
     a race condition in shared memory management

   - slurm/253: Try using different port if connect() fails (was rarely 
     failing when an existing defunct connection was in TIME_WAIT state)
   - slurm/300: Possibly killing wrong job on slurmd restart
   - slurm/312: Freeing non-allocated memory and killing slurmd
 -- Assorted changes to support RedHat Enterprise Linux 3.0 and IA64
 -- Initial Elan4 and libelanctrl support (--with-elan).
 -- Slurmctld was sometimes inappropriately setting a job's priority 
    to 1 when a node was down (even if up nodes could be used for the 
    job when a running job completes)

    rather than previously saved state. Additional improvements to 
    avoid inconsistent job/node/partition states at restart. Job state 
    information is used to arbitrate conflicts.
 -- Orphaned file descriptors eliminated.

* Changes in SLURM 0.2.16
=========================
 -- Fixes for reported problems:
   - slurm/265: Early termination of srun could cause job to remain in queue.
