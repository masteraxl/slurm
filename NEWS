This file describes changes in recent versions of SLURM. It primarily
documents those changes that are of interest to users and admins. 

* Changes in SLURM 0.3.9
========================
 -- Fixes for reported problems:
   - slurm/512: Let job steps run on DRAINING nodes
   - slurm/513: Gracefully deal with UIDs missing from passwd file
 -- Create new allocation as needed for debugger in case old allocation
    has been purged
 -- Fix bug in scheduling jobs when a processor count is specified 
    and FastSchedule=0 and the cluster is heterogeneous.
 -- Fix srun bug when --input, --output and --error are all "none"
 -- Allow single task id to be selected with --input, --output, and --error.

* Changes in SLURM 0.3.7
========================
 -- Fixes required for TotalView operability under RHEL3.0
    (Reported by Dong Ahn <dahn@llnl.gov>)
   - Do not create detached threads when running under parallel debugger.
   - Handle EINTR from sigwait().

* Changes in SLURM 0.3.6
========================
 -- Fixes for reported problems:
   - slurm/459: Properly support partition's "Shared=force" configuration.
 -- Resync node state to DRAINED or DRAINING on restart in case job 
    and node state recovered are out of sync.
 -- Added jobcomp/script plugin (execute script on job completion, 
    from Nathan Huff, North Dakota State University).
 -- Added new error code ESLURM_FRAGMENTED for immediate resource 
    allocation requests which are refused due to completing job (formerly 
    returned ESLURM_NOT_TOP_PRIORITY)
 -- Modified job completion logging plugin calling sequence.
 -- Added much of the infrastructure required for system checkpoint
    (APIs, RPCs, and NULL plugin)

* Changes in SLURM 0.3.5
========================
 -- Fix "SLURM_RLIMIT_* not found in environment" error message when
    distributing large rlimit to jobs.
 -- Add support for slurm_spawn() and associated APIs (needed for IBM 
    SP systems).
 -- Fix bug in update of node state to DRAINING/DRAINED when update 
    request occurs prior to initial node registration.
 -- Fix bug in purging of batch jobs (active batch jobs were being 
    improperly purged starting in version 0.3.0).
 -- When updating a node state to DRAINING/DRAINED a Reason must be 
    provided. The user name and a timestamp will automatically be 
    appended to that Reason.

* Changes in SLURM 0.3.4
========================
 -- Fixes for reported problems:
   - slurm/404: Explicitly set pthread stack size to 1MB for srun
 -- Allow srun to respond to ctrl-c and kill queued job while waiting
    for allocation from controller.

* Changes in SLURM 0.3.3

    switch (was setting DRAINED nodes in state DRAINING).
 -- Fix sinfo -R, --list-reasons to list all relevant node states.
 -- Fix slurmctld to honor srun's node configuration specifications 
    with FastSchedule==0 configuration.
 -- Added srun option --debugger-test to confirm that slurm's debugger 
    infrastructure is operational.

    RPM's debugedit utility if available for similar effect.

* Changes in SLURM 0.3.2
========================
 -- The srun command wakes immeditely upon resource allocation (via new RPC)
    rather than polling.
 -- SLURM daemons log current version number at startup.
 -- If slurmd can't respond to ping (e.g. paging is keeping it from 
    responding in a timely fashion) then send a registration RPC
    to slurmctld.
 -- Fix slurmd -M option to call mlockall() after daemonizing.
 -- Add "slurm_" prefix to slurm's hostlist_ function man pages.
 -- More AIX support added.

    with #define for SHOW_ALL flag. 

* Changes in SLURM 0.3.1
========================
 -- Set SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE env var for batch jobs (and LAM/MPI).
 -- Fix for slurmd spinning when stdin buffers full (gnats:434)
 -- Change some slurmctld malloc sizes to reduce demand for realloc calls, 
    improves performance and eliminates realloc failure on RH EL3 under 
    extremely heavy workload apparently due to memory fragmentation.
 -- Fix scheduling logic for heterogeneous processor count.
 -- Modify security_2_2 test to function with release 0.3
 -- Fix broken rpm build when libslurm not already installed.
 -- New slurmd option -M to mlock() slurmd process into memory.
 -- New srun option --no-shell causes srun to exit instead of spawning 
    shell when using --allocate, -A.
 -- Modify  srun --uid=user and --gid=group options to maintain invoking 
    user's credentials until after nodes have been allocated to requested 
    user/group (allows root to run jobs and allocate nodes for other users 
    in a RootOnly partition).
 -- Fix node processing if state change requested via scontrol prior to 
    initial node registration.
 
* Changes in SLURM 0.3.0
========================
 -- Support for AIX added (a few bugs do remain).
 -- Fix memory leak in slurmctld, slurm_cred_create().
 -- On ELF systems, export BNR_* functions from SLURM API. 
 -- Add support for "hidden" partitions (applies to their 
    nodes, jobs, and job steps as well). APIs and commands 
    modified to optionally display hidden partitions.
 -- Modify partition's group_allow test to be based upon the user 
    of the allocation rather than the user making the allocation 
    request (user root for LCRM batch jobs).
 -- Restructure plugin directory structure.
 -- New --core=type option in srun for lightweight corefile support.
    (requires liblwcf).
 -- Let user root and SlurmUser exceed any partition limits.
 -- Srun treats "--time=0" as a request for an infinite time limit.
 
* Changes in SLURM 0.3.0.0-pre10
================================
 -- Fix bugs in support of slurmctld "-f" option (specify different 
    slurm.conf pathname).
 -- Remove slurmd "-f" option.
 -- Several documenation changes for slurm administrators.
 -- On ELF systems, export only slurm_* functions from slurm API and 
    ensure plugins use only slurm_ prefixed functions (created aliases
    where necessary).
 -- New srun option -Q, --quiet to suppress informational messages.
 -- Fix bug in slurmctld's building of nodelist for job (failed if 
    more than one numeric field in node name).
 -- Change "scontrol completing" and "sinfo" to use job's node bitmap
    to identify nodes associated with that particular job that are 
    still processing job completion. This will work properly for 
    shared nodes.
 -- Set SLURM_DISTRIBUTION environment varible for user tasks.
 -- Fix for file descriptor leak in slurmd.
 -- Propagate stacksize limit to jobs along with other resource limits
    that were previously ignored.

* Changes in SLURM 0.3.0.0-pre9
===============================
 -- Restructure how slurmctld state saves are performed for better 
    scalability.
 -- New sinfo option "--list-reason" or "-R". Displays down or drained 
    nodes along with their REASON field.

* Changes in SLURM 0.3.0.0-pre8
===============================
 -- Queue outgoing message traffic rather than immediately spawning 
    pthreads (under heavy load this resulted in hundreds of pthreads 
    using more memory than was available).
 -- Restructure slurmctld message agent for higher throughput.
 -- Add new sinfo options --responding and --dead (i.e. non-responding)
    for filtering node states.
 -- Fix bug in sinfo to properly process specified state filter including
    "*" suffix for non-responding nodes.
 -- Create StateSaveLocation directory if changes via slurmctld reconfig

* Changes in SLURM 0.3.0.0-pre7
===============================
 -- Fixes for reported problems:
   - slurm/381: Hold jobs requesting more resources than partition limit.
   - slurm/387: Jobs lost and nodes DOWN on slurmctld restart.
 -- Add support for getting node's real memory size on AIX.
 -- Sinfo sort partitions in slurm.conf order, new sort option ("#P").
 -- Document how to gracefully change plugin values.
 -- Slurmctld does not attempt to recover jobs when the switch plugin
    value changes (decision reached when any job's switch state recovery
    fails).
 -- Node does not transition from COMPLETING to DOWN state due to
    not responding. Wait for tasks to complete or admin to set DOWN.
 -- Always chmod SlurmdSpoolDir to 755 (a umask of 007 was resulting 
    in batch jobs failing).
 -- Return errors when trying to change configuration parameters
    AuthType, SchedulerType, and SwitchType via "scontrol reconfig"
    or SIGHUP. Document how to safely change these parameters.
 -- Plugin-specific error number definitions and descriptive strings 
    moved from common into plugin modules.
 -- Documentation for writing scheduler, switch, and job completion 
    logging plugins added.
 -- Added job and node state descriptions to the squeue and sinfo man pages.
 -- Backup slurmctld to generate core file on SIGABRT.
 -- Backup slurmctld to re-read slurm.conf on SIGHUP.
 -- Added -q,--quit-on-interrupt option to srun.
 -- Elan switch plugin now starts neterr resolver thread on all Elan3
    systems (QsNet and QsNetII).
 -- Added some missing read locks for references for slurmctld's 
    configuration data structure
 -- Modify processing of queued slurmctld message traffic to get better
    throughput (resulted in job inactivity limit being reached improperly 
    when hundreds of jobs running simultaneously)

* Changes in SLURM 0.3.0.0-pre6
===============================
 -- Fixes for reported problems:
   - slurm/372: job state descriptions added to squeue man page

    systems with Quadrics Elan3 or Elan4 switches.
 -- Don't treat DOWN nodes with too few CPUs as a fatal error on Elan
 -- Major re-write of html documents
 -- Updates to node pinging for large numbers of unresponsive nodes 
 -- Explicitly set default action for SIGTERM (action on Thunder was 
    to ignore SIGTERM)
 -- Sinfo "--exact" option only applies to fields actually displayed
 -- Partition processor count not correctly computed for heterogeneous 
    clusters with FastSchedule=0 configuration
 -- Only return DOWN nodes to service if the reason for them being in 
    that state is non-responsiveness and "ReturnToService=1" configuration
 -- Partition processor count now correctly computed for heterogeneous 
    clusters with FastSchedule configured off
 -- New macros and function to export SLURM version number

     losing track of jobs
   - slurm/329: Job processing may be left running when one task dies
   - slurm/333: Slurmd fails to launch a job and deletes a step, due to 
     a race condition in shared memory management
   - slurm/334: Slurmd was getting a segv due to a race condition in shared 
     memory management
   - slurm/342: Properly handle nodes being removed from configuration 
     even when there are partitions, nodes, or job steps still associated 
     with them
 -- Srun properly terminates jobs/steps upon node failure (used to hang 
    waiting for I/O completion)

    is requested.

* Changes in SLURM 0.2.21
=========================
 -- Fixes for reported problems:
   - slurm/253: Try using different port if connect() fails (was rarely 
     failing when an existing defunct connection was in TIME_WAIT state)

   - slurm/312: Freeing non-allocated memory and killing slurmd
 -- Assorted changes to support RedHat Enterprise Linux 3.0 and IA64
 -- Initial Elan4 and libelanctrl support (--with-elan).
 -- Slurmctld was sometimes inappropriately setting a job's priority 
    to 1 when a node was down (even if up nodes could be used for the 
    job when a running job completes)
 -- Convert all user commands from use of popt library to getopt_long()
 -- If TotalView support is requested, srun exports "totalview_jobid"
    variable for `%J' expansion in TV bulk launch string.

    jobs complete
 -- Do not schedule pending jobs while any job is actively COMPLETING 
    unless the submitted job specifically identifies its nodes (like DPCS)
 -- Reset priority of jobs with priority==1 when a non-responding node 
    starts to respond again
 -- Ignore jobs with priority==1 when establishing new baseline upon 
    slurmctld restart
 -- Make slurmctld/message retry be timer based rather than queue based 
    for better scalability

 -- Fixes for reported problems:
   - slurm/279: Hold jobs that can't execute due to DOWN or DRAINED 
     nodes and release when nodes are returned to service.
   - slurm/285: "srun killed due to SIGPIPE"
 -- Support for running job steps on nodes relative to current 
    allocation via srun -r, --relative=n option.

    them unless detailed debugging is requested.
 -- Increase number of concurrent controller server threads from 20 
    to 50 and restructure code to handle backlogs more efficiently.

    rather than previously saved state. Additional improvements to 
    avoid inconsistent job/node/partition states at restart. Job state 
    information is used to arbitrate conflicts.
 -- Orphaned file descriptors eliminated.

* Changes in SLURM 0.2.16
=========================
 -- Fixes for reported problems:
   - slurm/265: Early termination of srun could cause job to remain in queue.
   - slurm/268: Slurmctld could deadlock if there was a delay in the 
     termination of a large node-count job. An EPILOG_COMPLETE RPC was 
     added so that slurmd could notify slurmctld whenever the job 
     termination was completed.
   - slurm/270: Segfault in sinfo if a configured node lacked a partition.

 -- Squeue job TIMELIMIT format changed from "h:mm" to "d:h:mm:ss".
 -- DPCS initiated jobs have steps execute properly without explicit 
    specification of node count.

   - slurm/194: "srun doesn't handle most options when run under an allocation."
   - slurm/244: "REQ: squeue shows requested size of pending jobs."
 -- SLURM_NODELIST environment variable now exported to all jobs, not
    only batch jobs.
 -- Nodelist displayed in squeue for completing jobs is now restricted to 
    completing nodes.
 -- Node "reason" field properly displayed in sinfo even with filtering.

 -- Controller confirms job scripts for batch jobs are still running on 
    node zero at node registration.
 -- Default RPMs no longer stop/start SLURM daemons on upgrade or install.

* Changes in SLURM 0.2.13
=========================
 -- Fixes for reported problems:
   - Fixed bug in slurmctld where "drained" nodes would go back into
     the "idle" state under some conditions (slurm/228).
   - Added possible fix for slurm/229: "slurmd occasionally fails
     to reap all children."
 -- Fixed memory leak in auth_munge plugin.
 -- Added fix to slurmctld to allow arbitrarily large job specifications
    to be saved and recovered in the state file.
