 *  Function:  ll_event
 *
 *  Description: This function will read and/or select on the listen socket
 *  created by the ll_init_job call. If the listen socket of the jobmgmtObj
 *  is not ready to read, this function will do a select and wait. Any
 *  interactive processes should monitor this socket at all times for event
 *  notification from LoadLeveler. This function returns a pointer to the job
 *  that was updated by the transaction and a list of step within the that job
 *  that had a status change.
 *
 *  Arguments:
 *    IN jobmgmtObj : Pointer to the LL_element handle returned by the
 *    			ll_init_job function.
 *    IN int msecs : Milliseconds to wait for event before timeout.
 *    OUT job : Pointer to the LL_element handle representing the job
 *    			that had an event update.
 *    OUT steplist : Array of stepids representing which steps within
 *    			the job had a status update.
 *    RET STATUS_EVENT : Job was returned with updated status.
 *        TIMER_EVENT :  Timer popped before any event occured.
 *        ERROR_EVENT :  Error occured.
