<b>1. Why is my job/node in <i>completing</i> state?</b><br />
When a job is terminating both the job and its nodes enter the state
<i>completing</i>.
As the SLURM daemon on each node determines that all processes associated 
with the job have terminated, that node changes state to <i>idle</i> or 
some other appropriate state.
When every node allocated to a job has determined that all processes 
associated with it have terminated, the job changes state to <i>completed</i> 
or some other appropriate state.
Normally this happens within a fraction of one second. 
However if the job has processes which can not be terminated with a SIGKILL, 
the job and one or more nodes can remain in the <i>completing</i> state for 
an extended period of time.
This may be indicative of processes hung waiting for a core file to completed 
I/O or operating system failure. 
If this state persists, the system administrator should use the <b>scontrol</b>
command to change the node's state to <i>down</i>, reboot the node, then reset 
the node's state to <i>idle</i>.

<a name="rlimit">
<b>2. Why do I see the error "Can't propagate RLIMIT_..."?</b><br />
When the <b>srun</b> command executes, it captures the resource limits in 
effect at that time.
These limits are propagated to the allocated nodes before initiating the 
user's job.
If the soft resource limits on the job submit host are higher than the 
hard resource limits on the allocated host, SLURM will be unable to 
propagate the resource limits and print an error of the type shown above. 
It is recommended that the system administrator establish uniform hard 
resource limits on all nodes within a cluster to prevent this from occurring.
