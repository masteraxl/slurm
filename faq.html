<li><a href="#comp">Why is my job/node in &quot;completing&quot; state?</a></li>

<p><a name="comp"><b>1. Why is my job/node in &quot;completing&quot; state?</b></a><br>
When a job is terminating, both the job and its nodes enter the state &quot;completing.&quot; 
As the SLURM daemon on each node determines that all processes associated with 
the job have terminated, that node changes state to &quot;idle&quot; or some other 
appropriate state. When every node allocated to a job has determined that all 
processes associated with it have terminated, the job changes state to &quot;completed&quot; 
or some other appropriate state. Normally, this happens within a fraction of one 
second. However, if the job has processes that cannot be terminated with a SIGKILL, 
the job and one or more nodes can remain in the completing state for an extended 
period of time. This may be indicative of processes hung waiting for a core file 
to complete I/O or operating system failure. If this state persists, the system 
administrator should use the <span class="commandline">scontrol</span> command 
to change the node's state to &quot;down,&quot; reboot the node, then reset the 
node's state to idle.</p>
<p><a name="rlimit"><b>2. Why do I see the error &quot;Can't propagate RLIMIT_...&quot;?</b></a><br>
When the <span class="commandline">srun</span> command executes, it captures the 
resource limits in effect at that time. These limits are propagated to the allocated 
nodes before initiating the user's job. If the soft resource limits on the job 
submit host are higher than the hard resource limits on the allocated host, SLURM 
will be unable to propagate the resource limits and print an error of the type 
shown above. It is recommended that the system administrator establish uniform 
hard resource limits on all nodes within a cluster to prevent this from occurring.</p>
<p><a name="pending"><b>3. Why is my job not running?</b></a><br>
The answer to this question depends upon the scheduler used by SLURM. Executing 
the command</p>
<blockquote> 
<p> <span class="commandline">scontrol show config | grep SchedulerType</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p> will supply this information. If the scheduler type is <b>builtin</b>, then 
jobs will be executed in the order of submission for a given partition. Even if 
resources are available to initiate your job immediately, it will be deferred 
until no previously submitted job is pending. If the scheduler type is <b>backfill</b>, 
then jobs will generally be executed in the order of submission for a given partition 
with one exception: later submitted jobs will be initiated early if doing so does 
not delay the expected execution time of an earlier submitted job. In order for 
backfill scheduling to be effective, users jobs should specify reasonable time 
limits. If jobs do not specify time limits, then all jobs will receive the same 
time limit (that associated with the partition), and the ability to backfill schedule 
jobs will be limited. The backfill scheduler does not alter job specifications 
of required or excluded nodes, so jobs which specify nodes will substantially 
reduce the effectiveness of backfill scheduling. If the scheduler type is <b>wiki</b>, 
this represents <a href="http://supercluster.org/maui">The Maui Scheduler</a>. 
Please refer to its documentation for help. For any scheduler, you can check priorities 
of jobs using the command <span class="commandline">scontrol show job</span>.</p></td>
