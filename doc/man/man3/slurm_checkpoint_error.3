.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.LP 
.TP
\fIerror_code\fP
Error code for checkpoint operation. Only the highest value is preserved.
.TP
\fIerror_msg\fP
Error message for checkpoint operation. Only the \fIerror_msg\fP value for the highest 
\fIerror_code\fP is preserved.
.TP
\fIjob_id\fP
SLURM job ID to perform the operation upon.
.TP
\fImax_wait\fP
Maximum time to allow for the operation to complete in seconds.
.TP
\fIstart_time\fP
Time at which last checkpoint operation began (if one is in progress), otherwise zero.
.TP
\fIstep_id\fP
SLURM job step ID to perform the operation upon. 
May be NO_VAL if the operation is to be performed on all steps of the specified job.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
\fBslurm_checkpoint_able\fR
Report if checkpoint operations can presently be issued for the specified job step.
If yes, returns SLURM_SUCCESS and sets \fIstart_time\fP if checkpoint operation is 
presently active. Returns ESLURM_DISABLED if checkpoint operation is disabled.
.LP
\fBslurm_checkpoint_complete\fR
Note that a requested checkpoint has been completed.
.LP
\fBslurm_checkpoint_create\fR
Request a checkpoint for the identified job step. 
Continue its execution upon completion of the checkpoint.
.LP
\fBslurm_checkpoint_disable\fR
Make the identified job step non-checkpointable. 
This can be issued as needed to prevent checkpointing while 
a job step is in a critical section or for other reasons.
.LP
\fBslurm_checkpoint_enable\fR
Make the indentified job step checkpointable.
.LP
\fBslurm_checkpoint_error\fR
Get error information about the last checkpoint operation for a given job step.
.LP
\fBslurm_checkpoint_restart\fR
Request that a previously checkpointed job resume execution.
It may continue execution on differrent nodes than were 
originally used.
Execution may be delayed if resources are not immediately 
available.
.LP
\fBslurm_checkpoint_vacate\fR
Request a checkpoint for the identified job step.
Terminate its execution upon completion of the checkpoint.


.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.LP
Zero is returned upon success. 
On error, -1 is returned, and the Slurm error code is set appropriately.
.SH "ERRORS"
.LP
\fBESLURM_INVALID_JOB_ID\fR the requested job or job step id does not exist. 
.LP
\fBESLURM_ACCESS_DENIED\fR the requesting user lacks authorization for the requested 
action (e.g. trying to delete or modify another user's job). 
.LP
\fBESLURM_DISABLED\fR the requested operation has been disabled for this job step.
This will occur when a request for checkpoint is issued when they have been disabled.
.LP
\fBESLURM_NOT_SUPPORTED\fR the requested operation is not supported on this system.
