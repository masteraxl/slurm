.SH "NAME"
slurmdbd.conf \- Slurm Database Daemon (SlurmDBD) configuration file 

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fB/etc/slurmdbe.conf\fP is an ASCII file which describes Slurm Database 
Daemon (SlurmDBD) configuration information.
.LP
The file location can be modified at system build time using the
DEFAULT_SLURM_CONF parameter. 
The contents of the file are case insensitive except for the names of nodes 
and files. Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated 
as a comment through the end of that line. 
The size of each line in the file is limited to 1024 characters.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of 
SlurmDbd or daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal unless otherwise noted.
.LP
The overall configuration parameters available include:

.TP
\fBAuthInfo\fR
Additional information to be used for authentication of communications 
with the Slurm control daemon (slurmctld) on each cluster.
The interpretation of this option is specific to the configured \fBAuthType\fR.
In the case of \fIauth/munge\fR, this can be configured to use a Munge daemon 
specifically configured to provide authentication between clusters while the 
default Munge daemon provides authentication within a cluster. 
In that case, this will specify the pathname of the socket to use.
The default value is NULL, which results in the default authentication 
mechanism being used.

.TP
\fBAuthType\fR
Define the authentication method for communications between SLURM 
components. 
Acceptable values at present include "auth/none", "auth/authd", 
and "auth/munge".
The default value is "auth/none", which means the UID included in 
communication messages is not verified. 
This may be fine for testing purposes, but 
\fBdo not use "auth/none" if you desire any security\fR.
"auth/authd" indicates that Brett Chun's authd is to be used (see
"http://www.theether.org/authd/" for more information).
"auth/munge" indicates that LLNL's Munge system is to be used
(this is the best supported authentication mechanism for SLURM, 
see "http://home.gna.org/munge/" for more information).
SlurmDbd must be terminated prior to changing the value of \fBAuthType\fR 
and later restarted.

.TP
\fBDbdAddr\fR
Name that \fBDbdHost\fR should be referred to in 
establishing a communications path to the Slurm Database Daemon. 
This name will be used as an argument to the gethostbyname() 
function for identification. For example, "elx0000" might be used 
to designate the ethernet address for node "lx0000". 
By default the \fBDbdAddr\fR will be identical in value to 
\fBDbdHost\fR.
This value must be equal to the \fBSlurmDbdAddr\fR parameter in 
the slurm.conf file.

.TP
\fBDbdHost\fR
The name of the machine where the Slurm Database Daemon is executed. 
This should be a node name without the full domain name (e.g. "lx0001"). 
This value must be specified.

.TP
\fBDbdPort\fR
The port number that the Slurm Database Daemon (slurmdbd) listens 
to for work. The default value is SLURMDBD_PORT as established at system 
build time. If none is explicitly specified, it will be set to 6819.
This value must be equal to the \fBSlurmDbdPort\fR parameter in the
slurm.conf file.

.TP
\fBDebugLevel\fR
The level of detail to provide the Slurm Database Daemon's logs. 
Values from 0 to 7 are legal, with `0' being "quiet" operation and 
`7' being insanely verbose.
The default value is 3.

.TP
\fBLogFile\fR
Fully qualified pathname of a file into which the Slurm Database Daemon's 
logs are written.
The default value is none (performs logging via syslog).

.TP
\fBPidFile\fR
Fully qualified pathname of a file into which the Slurm Database Daemon 
may write its process ID. This may be used for automated signal processing.
The default value is "/var/run/slurmdbd.pid".

.TP
\fBSlurmUser\fR
The name of the user that the \fBslurmctld\fR daemon executes as. 
This user must exist on the machine executing the Slurm Database Daemon
and have the same user ID as the hosts on which \fBslurmctld\fR execute.
For security purposes, a user other than "root" is recommended.
The default value is "root". 

.TP
\fBStorageHost\fR
Define the name of the host the database is running where we are going
to store the data.
Ideally this should be the host on which slurmdbd executes.

.TP
\fBStoragePassword\fR
Define the password used to gain access to the database to store 
the job accounting data.

.TP
\fBStoragePort\fR
Define the password used to gain access to the database to store 
the job accounting data.

.TP
\fBStorageType\fR
Define the port the database server is listening on where we are going
to store the data.
.TP
\fBStorageUser\fR
Define the name of the user we are going to connect to the database
with to store the job accounting data.
