.TH SCONTROL "1" "May 2007" "scontrol 1.3" "Slurm components"

.SH "NAME"
scontrol \- Used view and modify Slurm configuration and state.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBscontrol\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] [\fICOMMAND\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBscontrol\fR is used to view or modify Slurm configuration including: job, 
job step, node, partition, and overall system configuration. Most of the 
commands can only be executed by user root. If an attempt to view or modify 
configuration information is made by an unauthorized user, an error message 
will be printed and the requested action will not occur. If no command is 
entered on the execute line, \fBscontrol\fR will operate in an interactive 
mode and prompt for input. It will continue prompting for input and executing 
commands until explicitly terminated. If a command is entered on the execute 
line, \fBscontrol\fR will execute that command and terminate. All commands 
and options are case\-insensitive, although node names and partition names 
are case\-sensitive (node names "LX" and "lx" are distinct). Commands can 
be abbreviated to the extent that the specification is unique.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
When the \fIshow\fR command is used, then display all partitions, their jobs 
and jobs steps. This causes information to be displayed about partitions 
that are configured as hidden and partitions that are unavailable to user's 
group.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print a help message describing the usage of scontrol.
.TP
\fB\-\-hide\fR
Do not display information about hidden partitions, their jobs and job steps. 
By default, neither partitions that are configured as hidden nor those partitions 
unavailable to user's group will be displayed (i.e. this is the default behavior).
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-oneliner\fR
Print information one line per record.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Print no warning or informational messages, only fatal error messages.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print detailed event logging. This includes time\-stamps on data structures, 
record counts, etc.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR , \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information and exit.
.TP
\fBCOMMANDS\fR

.TP
\fBall\fP
Show all partitiion, their jobs and jobs steps. This causes information to be 
displayed about partitions that are configured as hidden and partitions that
are unavailable to user's group.

.TP
\fBabort\fP
Instruct the Slurm controller to terminate immediately and generate a core file.

.TP
\fBcheckpoint\fP \fICKPT_OP\fP \fIID\fP
Perform a checkpoint activity on the job step(s) with the specified identification.
\fIID\fP can be used to identify a specific job (e.g. "<job_id>",
which applies to all of its existing steps)
or a specific job step (e.g. "<job_id>.<step_id>").
Acceptable values for \fICKPT_OP\fP include:
.RS
.TP
\fIdisable\fP (disable future checkpoints)
.TP 
\fIenable\fP (enable future checkpoints)
.TP
\fIable\fP (test if presently not disabled, report start time if checkpoint in progress)
.TP
\fIcreate\fP (create a checkpoint and continue the job step)
.TP
\fIvacate\fP (create a checkpoint and terminate the job step) 
.TP
\fIerror\fP (report the result for the last checkpoint request, error code and message) 
.TP
\fIrestart\fP (restart execution of the previously checkpointed job steps)
.RE

.TP
\fBcompleting\fP
Display all jobs in a COMPLETING state along with associated nodes in either a 
COMPLETING or DOWN state.

.TP
\fBdelete\fP \fISPECIFICATION\fP
Delete the entry with the specified \fISPECIFICATION\fP.
The only supported \fISPECIFICATION\fP presently is of the form
\fIPartitionName=<name>\fP.

.TP
\fBexit\fP
Terminate the execution of scontrol.
This is an independent command with no options meant for use in interactive mode.

.TP
\fBhelp\fP
Display a description of scontrol options and commands.

.TP
\fBhide\fP
Do not display partitiion, job or jobs step information for partitions that are 
configured as hidden or partitions that are unavailable to the user's group. 
This is the default behavior.

.TP
\fBoneliner\fP
Print information one line per record.
This is an independent command with no options meant for use in interactive mode.

.TP
\fBpidinfo\fP \fIPROC_ID\fP
Print the Slurm job id and scheduled termination time corresponding to the 
supplied process id, \fIPROC_ID\fP, on the current node.  This will work only
with processes on node on which scontrol is run, and only for those processes
spawned by SLURM and their descendants.

.TP
\fBlistpids\fP [JOBID[.STEPID]] [NodeName]
Print a listing of the process IDs in a job step (if JOBID.STEPID is provided),
or all of the job steps in a job (if JOBID is provided), or all of the job
steps in all of the jobs on the local node (if JOBID is not provided or JOBID
is "*").  This will work only with processes on the node on which
scontrol is run, and only for those processes spawned by SLURM and
their descendants. Note that some SLURM configurations
(\fIProctrackType\fP value of \fIpgid\fP or \fIaix\fP) 
are unable to identify all processes associated with a job or job step.

Note that the NodeName option is only really useful when you have multiple
slurmd daemons running on the same host machine.  Multiple slurmd daemons on
one host are, in general, only used by SLURM developers.

.TP
\fBping\fP
Ping the primary and secondary slurmctld daemon and report if 
they are responding.

.TP
\fBquiet\fP
Print no warning or informational messages, only fatal error messages.
This is an independent command with no options meant for use in interactive mode.

.TP
\fBquit\fP
Terminate the execution of scontrol.
This is an independent command with no options meant for use in interactive mode.

.TP
\fBreconfigure\fP
Instruct all Slurm daemons to re\-read the configuration file. 
This command does not restart the daemons.
This mechanism would be used to modify configuration parameters (Epilog, 
Prolog, SlurmctldLogFile, SlurmdLogFile, etc.) register the physical 
addition or removal of nodes from the cluster or recognize the change 
of a node's configuration, such as the addition of memory or processors. 
The Slurm controller (slurmctld) forwards the request all other daemons 
(slurmd daemon on each compute node). Running jobs continue execution.
Most configuration parameters can be changed by just running this command, 
however, SLURM daemons should be shutdown and restarted if any of these 
parameters are to be changed: AuthType, BackupAddr, BackupController, 
ControlAddr, ControlMach, PluginDir, StateSaveLocation, SlurmctldPort 
or SlurmdPort.

.TP
\fBresume\fP \fIjob_id\fP
Resume a previously suspended job.

.TP
\fBrequeue\fP \fIjob_id\fP
Requeue a running or pending SLURM batch job.

.TP
\fBshow\fP \fIENTITY\fP \fIID\fP
Display the state of the specified entity with the specified identification.
\fIENTITY\fP may be \fIconfig\fP, \fIdaemons\fP, \fIjob\fP, \fInode\fP, 
\fIpartition\fP or \fIstep\fP.
\fIID\fP can be used to identify a specific element of the identified 
entity: the configuration parameter name, job ID, node name, partition name, 
or job step ID for entities \fIconfig\fP, \fIjob\fP, \fInode\fP, \fIpartition\fP, 
and \fIstep\fP respectively. 
Multiple node names may be specified using simple node range expressions 
(e.g. "lx[10\-20]"). All other \fIID\fP values must identify a single 
element. The job step ID is of the form "job_id.step_id", (e.g. "1234.1").
By default, all elements of the entity type specified are printed.

.TP
\fBshutdown\fP
Instruct all Slurm daemons to save current state and terminate.
The Slurm controller (slurmctld) forwards the request all other daemons 
(slurmd daemon on each compute node). 

.TP
\fBsuspend\fP \fIjob_id\fP
Suspend a running job.
Use the \fIresume\fP command to resume its execution.
User processes must stop on receipt of SIGSTOP signal and resume 
upon receipt of SIGCONT for this operation to be effective.
Not all architectures and configurations support job suspension.

.TP
\fBupdate\fP \fISPECIFICATION\fP 
Update job, node or partition configuration per the supplied specification.
\fISPECIFICATION\fP is in the same format as the Slurm configuration file 
and the output of the \fIshow\fP command described above. It may be desirable 
to execute the \fIshow\fP command (described above) on the specific entity 
you which to update, then use cut\-and\-paste tools to enter updated configuration 
values to the \fIupdate\fP. Note that while most configuration values can be 
changed using this command, not all can be changed using this mechanism. In 
particular, the hardware configuration of a node or the physical addition or 
removal of nodes from the cluster may only be accomplished through editing 
the Slurm configuration file and executing the \fIreconfigure\fP command 
(described above).

.TP
\fBverbose\fP
Print detailed event logging. 
This includes time\-stamps on data structures, record counts, etc.
This is an independent command with no options meant for use in interactive mode.

.TP
\fBversion\fP
Display the version number of scontrol being executed.

.TP
\fB!!\fP
Repeat the last command executed.

.TP
\fBSPECIFICATIONS FOR UPDATE COMMAND, NODES\fR
.TP
\fINodeName\fP=<name>
Identify the node(s) to be updated. Multiple node names may be specified using 
simple node range expressions (e.g. "lx[10\-20]"). This specification is required.
.TP
\fIFeatures\fP=<features>
Identify features to be associated with the specified nodes.
Any previously identified features will be overwritten with the new value.
\fBNOTE:\fR The Features associated with nodes will be reset to
the values specified in slurm.conf (if any) upon slurmctld restart 
or reconfiguration.
Update slurm.conf with any changes meant to be persistent.
.TP
\fIReason\fP=<reason>
Identify the reason the node is in a "DOWN" or "DRAINED", "DRAINING", 
"FAILING" or "FAIL" state.
Use quotes to enclose a reason having more than one word.
.TP
\fIState\fP=<state>
Identify the state to be assigned to the node. Possible values are  "NoResp", 
"ALLOC", "ALLOCATED", "DOWN", "DRAIN", "FAIL", "FAILING", "IDLE" or "RESUME". 
"RESUME is not an actual node state, but will return a DRAINED, DRAINING, 
or DOWN node to service, either IDLE or ALLOCATED state as appropriate.
Setting a node "DOWN" will cause all running and suspended jobs on that
node to be terminated.
If you want to remove a node from service, you typically want to set 
it's state to "DRAIN". 
"FAILING" is similar to "DRAIN" except that some applications will  
seek to relinquish those nodes before the job completes.
The "NoResp" state will only set the "NoResp" flag for a node without
changing its underlying state.

.TP
\fBSPECIFICATIONS FOR UPDATE AND DELETE COMMANDS, PARTITIONS\fR
.TP
\fIAllowGroups\fP=<name>
Identify the user groups which may use this partition. 
Multiple groups may be specified in a comma separated list. 
To permit all groups to use the partition specify "AllowGroups=ALL".
.TP
\fIDefault\fP=<yes|no>
Specify if this partition is to be used by jobs which do not explicitly 
identify a partition to use. Possible values are"YES" and "NO".
.TP
\fIHidden\fP=<yes|no>
Specify if the partition and its jobs should be hidden from view. 
Hidden partitions will by default not be reported by SLURM APIs 
or commands. 
Possible values are"YES" and "NO".
.TP
\fIMaxNodes\fP=<count>
Set the maximum number of nodes which will be allocated to any single job 
in the partition. Specify a number or "INFINITE".
.TP

Set the maximum run time for a jobs in minutes. 
Specify a number or "INFINITE"
.TP
\fIMinNodes\fP=<count>
Set the minimum number of nodes which will be allocated to any single job 
in the partition. 
.TP
\fINodes\fP=<name>
Identify the node(s) to be associated with this partition. Multiple node names 
may be specified using simple node range expressions (e.g. "lx[10\-20]"). 
Note that jobs may only be associated with one partition at any time.
Specify a blank data value to remove all nodes from a partition: "Nodes=".
.TP
\fIPartitionName\fP=<name>
Identify the partition to be updated. This specification is required.
.TP
\fIRootOnly\fP=<yes|no>
Specify if only allocation requests initiated by user root will be satisfied. 
This can be used to restrict control of the partition to some meta\-scheduler. 
Possible values are"YES" and "NO".
.TP
\fIShared\fP=<yes|no|force>
Specify if nodes in this partition can be shared by multiple jobs. 
Possible values are"YES", "NO" and "FORCE".
.TP
\fIState\fP=<up|down>
Specify if jobs can be allocated nodes in this partition. 
Possible values are"UP" and "DOWN".
If a partition allocated nodes to running jobs, those jobs will continue 
execution even after the partition's state is set to "DOWN". The jobs 
must be explicitly canceled to force their termination.
.TP
\fBSPECIFICATIONS FOR UPDATE, BLOCK \fR
.TP
Bluegene systems only! 
.TP
\fIBlockName\fP=<name>
Identify the bluegene block to be updated. This specification is required.
.TP
\fIState\fP=<free|error>
This will update the state of a bluegene block to either FREE or ERROR. 
(i.e. update BlockName=RMP0 STATE=ERROR) State error will not allow jobs
to run on the block. \fBWARNING!!!!\fR This will cancel any
running job on the block!
.TP
\fISubBPName\fP=<name>
Identify the bluegene ionodes to be updated (i.e. bg000[0-3]). This
specification is required.
.TP
