.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Accounting information for jobs invoked with SLURM are logged in the job 
accounting log file.
.PP
The 
.BR "sacct "
command displays job accounting data stored in the job accounting log 
file in a variety of forms for your analysis.
The 
.BR "sacct "
command displays information on jobs, job steps, status, and errors by 
default.
You can tailor the output with the use of the 
\f3--fields=\fP 
option to specify the fields to be shown.
.PP
For the root user, the 
.BR "sacct "
command displays job accounting data for all users, although there are 
options to filter the output to report only the jobs from a specified 
user or group.
.PP
For the non-root user, the 
.BR "sacct "
command limits the display of job accounting data to jobs that were 
launched with their own user identifier (UID) by default.
Data for other users can be displayed with the 
\f3--all\fP,
\f3--user\fP,
or 
\f3--uid\fP 
options.
.TP "10"
\f3Note: \fP\c
Much of the data reported by \f3sacct\fP has been generated by
the \f2wait3()\fP and \f2getrusage()\fP system calls. Some systems
gather and report incomplete information for these calls;
\f3sacct\fP reports values of 0 for this missing data. See your system's
\f2getrusage(3)\fP man page for information about which data are
actually available on your system.
.SS "Options"
.TP "10"
\f3\-a \fP\f3,\fP \f3--all\fP
Displays the job accounting data for all jobs in the job accounting log file.
.IP 
This is the default behavior when the 
.BR "sacct "
command is executed by the root user.
.TP 
\f3\-b \fP\f3,\fP \f3--brief\fP

Displays (dumps) the raw data records.
.IP 
This option overrides the 
\f3--brief\fP 
and 
\f3--fields=\fP 
options.
.IP 
The section titled "INTERPRETING THE --dump OPTION OUTPUT" describes the 
data output when this option is used.
.TP
\f3-e \fP\f2time_spec\fP \f3,\fP \f3--expire=\fP\f2time_spec\fP
.IP
Removes job data from SLURM's current accounting log file (or the file
specified with \f3--file\fP) for jobs that completed more than
\f2time_spec\fP
ago and appends them to the expired log file.
.IP
If \f2time_spec\fP is an integer value only, it is interpreted as minutes. If
\f2time_spec\fP is an integer followed by "h", it is interpreted as
a number of hours. If \f2time_spec\fP is an integer followed by "d",
it is interpreted as number of days. For example, "--expire=14d" 
purges the job accounting log of all jobs that completed
more than 14 days ago.
.IP
The expired log file is a file with the same name as the accounting
log file, with ".expired" appended to the file name. For example, if
the accounting log file is /var/log/slurmacct.log, the expired log
file will be /var/log/slurmacct.log.expired.
.TP 
\f3\-F \fP\f2field_list\fP \f3,\fP  \f3---fields\fP\f3=\fP\f2field_list\fP

The output for the

Total CPU time, Total User CPU time, and Total System CPU time.
The first field of each pair is the time in seconds expressed as an

The second field of each pair is the fractional number of seconds 
multiplied by one million.
Thus, a pair of fields output as "\c

The least significant digits in the second field are truncated in
