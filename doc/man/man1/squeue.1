.SH "NAME"
squeue \- view information about jobs located in the SLURM scheduling queue.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsqueue\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] 

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsqueue\fR is used to view job and job step information for jobs managed by 
SLURM. 

.TP
OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
Display information about jobs and job steps in all partions. 
This causes information to be displayed about partitions that are configured as 
hidden and partitions that are unavailable to user's group.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Print a help message describing all options \fBsqueue\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-hide\fR
Do not display information about jobs and job steps in all partions. By default, 
information about partitions that are configured as hidden or are not available 
to the user's group will not be displayed (i.e. this is the default behavior).
.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Print a brief help message listing the \fBsqueue\fR options.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-noheader\fR
Do not print a header on the output.
.TP
\fB\-i <seconds>\fR, \fB\-\-iterate=<seconds>\fR
Repeatedly gather and report the requested information at the interval
specified (in seconds).
By default, prints a time stamp with the header.
.TP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-jobs\fR
Specify the jobs to view.  This flag indicates that a comma separated list 
of jobs to view follows without an equal sign (see examples).
Defaults to all jobs.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-long\fR
Report more of the available information for the selected jobs or job steps, 
subject to any constraints specified.
.TP
\fB\-n <node_name>\fR, \fB\-\-node=<node_name>\fR
Report only on jobs allocated to the specified node.
This may either be the \fBNodeName\fR or \fBNodeHostname\fR
as defined in \fBslurm.conf(5)\fR in the event that they differ.
A node_name of \fBlocalhost\fR is mapped to the current host name.
.TP
\fB\-o <output_format>\fR, \fB\-\-format=<output_format>\fR
Specify the information to be displayed.  
The default format for jobs is 
If the \fB\-\-long\fR option is specified, the default job format is 
Format strings used internally by \fBsqueue\fR when running with
various options are

Account associated with the job
.TP
\fB%b\fR

.TP
\fB%c\fR

This reports the value of the \fBsrun \-\-mincpus\fR option with a 
default value of zero.
.TP
\fB%C\fR

This reports the value of the \fBsrun \-\-ntasks\fR option with a
default value of zero.

\fB%d\fR 
Minimum size of temporary disk space (in MB) requested by the job.
.TP
\fB%D\fR 
Number of nodes allocated to the job or the minimum number of nodes 
required by a pending job. The actual number of nodes allocated to a pending 
job may exceed this number of the job specified a node range count or the 
cluster contains nodes with varying processor counts.
.TP
\fB%e\fR 
Time at which the job ended or is expected to end (based upon its time limit)
.TP
\fB%E\fR

completes.  A value of zero implies this job has no dependencies.
.TP
\fB%f\fR

.TP
\fB%g\fR 
Group name
.TP
\fB%G\fR

The days and hours are printed only as needed.
.TP
\fB%n\fR
List of node names explicitly requested by the job
.TP
\fB%N\fR
List of nodes allocated to the job or job step. In the case of a 
\fICOMPLETING\fR job, the list of nodes will comprise only those
nodes that have not yet been returned to service. This may result 
in the node count being greater than the number of listed nodes.
.TP
\fB%o\fR
Minimum number of nodes requested by the job.
.TP
\fB%O\fR
Are contiguous nodes requested by the job
.TP
\fB%p\fR

See the \fBJOB REASON CODES\fR section below for more information.
.TP
\fB%R\fR
For running or completed jobs: the list of allocate nodes.
For pending jobs: the reason a job is waiting for execution 
is printed within parenthesis. 
See the \fBJOB REASON CODES\fR section below for more information.
.TP
\fB%s\fR

Geometry requirement of resource allocation (X,Y,Z dimensions),

\fB%T\fR 
Job state, extended form: 
PENDING, RUNNING, SUSPENDED, CANCELLED, COMPLETING, COMPLETED, FAILED, TIMEOUT, 
and NODE_FAIL.
See the \fBJOB STATE CODES\fR section below for more information.
.TP
\fB%u\fR 
User name

.RE
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Display all job information.
.TP
\fB\-p <part_list>\fR, \fB\-\-partition=<part_list>\fR
Specify the partitions of the jobs or steps to view. Accepts a comma separated 
list of partition names.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-steps\fR

of job steps to view follows without an equal sign (see examples).
The job step format is "job_id.step_id". Defaults to all job steps.
.TP
\fB\-S <sort_list>\fR, \fB\-\-sort=<sort_list>\fR
Specification of the order in which records should be reported.
This uses the same field specifciation as the <output_format>.
Multiple sorts may be performed by listing multiple sort fields 
separated by commas.
The field specifications may be preceeded by "+" or "\-" for 
assending (default) and desending order respectively. 
For example, a sort value of "P,U" will sort the
records by partition name then by user id. 
The default value of sort for jobs is "P,t,\-p" (increasing partition 
name then within a given partition by increasing node state and then 
decreasing priority).
The default value of sort for job steps is "P,i" (increasing partition 
name then within a given partition by increasing step id).
.TP
\fB\-t <state_list>\fR, \fB\-\-states=<state_list>\fR
Specify the states of jobs to view.  Accepts a comma separated list of
state names or "all". If "all" is specified then jobs of all states will be 
reported. If no state is specified then pending, running, and completing
jobs are reported. Valid states (in both extended and compact form) include:
PENDING (PD), RUNNING (R), SUSPENDED (S), 
COMPLETING (CG), COMPLETED (CD), CANCELLED (CA),
FAILED (F), TIMEOUT (TO), and NODE_FAIL (NF). Note the \fB<state_list>\fR
supplied is case insensitve ("pd" and "PD" work the same).
See the \fBJOB STATE CODES\fR section below for more information.
.TP
\fB\-u <user_list>\fR, \fB\-\-user=<user_list>\fR
Specifies a comma separated list of users whose jobs or job steps are to be
reported. The list can consist of user names or user id numbers.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Report details of squeues actions.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR , \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information and exit.

.SH "JOB REASON CODES"
