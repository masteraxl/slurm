.TH SQUEUE "1" "July 2009" "squeue 2.1" "Slurm components"

.SH "NAME"
squeue \- view information about jobs located in the SLURM scheduling queue.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsqueue\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] 

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsqueue\fR is used to view job and job step information for jobs managed by 
SLURM. 

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
Display information about jobs and job steps in all partions. 
This causes information to be displayed about partitions that are configured as 
hidden and partitions that are unavailable to user's group.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-noheader\fR
Do not print a header on the output.

.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Print a help message describing all options \fBsqueue\fR.

.TP
\fB\-\-hide\fR
Do not display information about jobs and job steps in all partions. By default, 
information about partitions that are configured as hidden or are not available 
to the user's group will not be displayed (i.e. this is the default behavior).

.TP
\fB\-i <seconds>\fR, \fB\-\-iterate=<seconds>\fR
Repeatedly gather and report the requested information at the interval
specified (in seconds).
By default, prints a time stamp with the header.

.TP
\fB\-j <job_id_list>\fR, \fB\-\-jobs=<job_id_list>\fR
Requests a comma separated list of job ids to display.  Defaults to all jobs.
The \fB\-\-jobs=<job_id_list>\fR option may be used in conjunction with the
\fB\-\-steps\fR option to print step information about specific jobs.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-long\fR
Report more of the available information for the selected jobs or job steps, 
subject to any constraints specified.

.TP
\fB\-n <hostlist>\fR, \fB\-\-nodes=<hostlist>\fR
Report only on jobs allocated to the specified node or list of nodes.
This may either be the \fBNodeName\fR or \fBNodeHostname\fR
as defined in \fBslurm.conf(5)\fR in the event that they differ.
A node_name of \fBlocalhost\fR is mapped to the current host name.

.TP
\fB\-o <output_format>\fR, \fB\-\-format=<output_format>\fR
Specify the information to be displayed, its size and position 
(right or left justified).  
The default formats with various options are

.RS
.TP 15
\fIdefault\fR
"%.7i %.9P %.8j %.8u %.2t %.10M %.6D %R"
.TP
\fI\-l, \-\-long\fR
"%.7i %.9P %.8j %.8u %.8T %.10M %.9l %.6D %R"
.TP
\fI\-s, \-\-steps\fR
"%10i %.8j %.9P %.8u %.9M %N"
.RE

.IP
The format of each field is "%[.][size]type".
.RS
.TP 8
\fIsize\fR 
is the minimum field size.
If no size is specified, whatever is needed to print the information will be used.
.TP
\fI .\fR
indicates the output should be left justified.
By default, output is right justified.
.RE

.IP
Note that many of these \fItype\fR specifications are valid 
only for jobs while others are valid only for job steps.
Valid \fItype\fR specifications include: 

.RS
.TP 4
\fB%a\fR
Account associated with the job.
.TP
\fB%A\fR
Number of tasks created by a job step.
This reports the value of the \fBsrun \-\-ntasks\fR option.
.TP
\fB%c\fR 
Minimum number of CPUs (processors) per node requested by the job.
This reports the value of the \fBsrun \-\-mincpus\fR option with a 
default value of zero.
.TP
\fB%C\fR 
Number of CPUs (processors) requested by the job or allocated to 
it if already running.
.TP
\fB%d\fR 
Minimum size of temporary disk space (in MB) requested by the job.
.TP
\fB%D\fR 
Number of nodes allocated to the job or the minimum number of nodes 
required by a pending job. The actual number of nodes allocated to a pending 
job may exceed this number if the job specified a node range count (e.g. 
minimum and maximum node counts) or the the job specifies a processor 
count instead of a node count and the cluster contains nodes with varying 
processor counts.
.TP
\fB%e\fR 
Time at which the job ended or is expected to end (based upon its time limit)
.TP
\fB%E\fR
Job dependency. This job will not begin execution until the dependent job 
completes.  A value of zero implies this job has no dependencies.
.TP
\fB%f\fR 
Features required by the job.
.TP
\fB%g\fR 
Group name of the job.
.TP
\fB%G\fR
Group ID of the job.
.TP
\fB%h\fR
Can the nodes allocated to the job be shared with other jobs.
.TP
\fB%H\fR 
Minimum number of sockets per node requested by the job.
This reports the value of the \fBsrun \-\-minsockets\fR option.
.TP
\fB%i\fR
Job or job step id.
.TP
\fB%I\fR 
Minimum number of cores per socket requested by the job.
This reports the value of the \fBsrun \-\-mincores\fR option.
.TP
\fB%j\fR
Job or job step name.
.TP
\fB%J\fR 
Minimum number of threads per core requested by the job.
This reports the value of the \fBsrun \-\-minthreads\fR option.
.TP
\fB%l\fR
Time limit of the job or job step in days\-hours:minutes:seconds. 
The value may be "NOT_SET" if not yet established or "UNLIMITED" for no limit.
.TP
\fB%L\fR
Time left for the job to execute in days\-hours:minutes:seconds. 
This value is calculated by subtracting the job's time used from its time 
limit.
The value may be "NOT_SET" if not yet established or "UNLIMITED" for no limit.
.TP
\fB%m\fR
Minimum size of memory (in MB) requested by the job
.TP
\fB%M\fR
Time used by the job or job step in days\-hours:minutes:seconds. 
The days and hours are printed only as needed.
For job steps this field shows the elapsed time since execution began 
and thus will be inaccurate for job steps which have been suspended.
Clock skew between nodes in the cluster will cause the time to be inaccurate.
If the time is obviously wrong (e.g. negative), it displays as "INVALID".
.TP
\fB%n\fR
List of node names (or base partitions on BlueGene systems) explicitly 
requested by the job
.TP
\fB%N\fR
List of nodes allocated to the job or job step. In the case of a 
\fICOMPLETING\fR job, the list of nodes will comprise only those
nodes that have not yet been returned to service. This may result 
in the node count being greater than the number of listed nodes.
.TP
\fB%O\fR
Are contiguous nodes requested by the job.
.TP
\fB%p\fR
Priority of the job (converted to a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0).
Also see \fB%Q\fR.
.TP
\fB%P\fR 
Partition of the job or job step.
.TP
\fB%q\fR 
Comment associated with the job.
.TP
\fB%Q\fR
Priority of the job (generally a very large unsigned integer).
Also see \fB%p\fR.
.TP
\fB%r\fR

is printed within parenthesis.
For terminated jobs with failure: an explanation as to why the 
job failed is printed within parenthesis.
For all other job states: the list of allocate nodes.

Geometry requirement of resource allocation (X,Y,Z dimensions), 
Connection type (TORUS, MESH, or NAV == torus else mesh), 
Permit rotation of geometry (yes or no), 
Node use (VIRTUAL or COPROCESSOR),
etc.
.TP
\fB%S\fR

F (failed), TO (timeout), and NF (node failure).
See the \fBJOB STATE CODES\fR section below for more information.
.TP
\fB%T\fR

the job.
.RE

.TP
\fB\-p <part_list>\fR, \fB\-\-partition=<part_list>\fR
Specify the partitions of the jobs or steps to view. Accepts a comma separated 
list of partition names.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-steps\fR
Specify the job steps to view.  This flag indicates that a comma separated list 
of job steps to view follows without an equal sign (see examples).
The job step format is "job_id.step_id". Defaults to all job steps.

.TP
\fB\-S <sort_list>\fR, \fB\-\-sort=<sort_list>\fR
Specification of the order in which records should be reported.
This uses the same field specifciation as the <output_format>.
Multiple sorts may be performed by listing multiple sort fields 
separated by commas.
The field specifications may be preceeded by "+" or "\-" for 
ascending (default) and descending order respectively. 
For example, a sort value of "P,U" will sort the
records by partition name then by user id. 
The default value of sort for jobs is "P,t,\-p" (increasing partition 
name then within a given partition by increasing node state and then 
decreasing priority).
The default value of sort for job steps is "P,i" (increasing partition 
name then within a given partition by increasing step id).

.TP
\fB\-t <state_list>\fR, \fB\-\-states=<state_list>\fR
Specify the states of jobs to view.  Accepts a comma separated list of
state names or "all". If "all" is specified then jobs of all states will be 
reported. If no state is specified then pending, running, and completing
jobs are reported. Valid states (in both extended and compact form) include:
PENDING (PD), RUNNING (R), SUSPENDED (S), 
COMPLETING (CG), COMPLETED (CD), CONFIGURING (CF), CANCELLED (CA),
FAILED (F), TIMEOUT (TO), and NODE_FAIL (NF). Note the \fB<state_list>\fR
supplied is case insensitve ("pd" and "PD" work the same).
See the \fBJOB STATE CODES\fR section below for more information.

.TP
\fB\-U <account_list>\fR, \fB\-\-account=<account_list>\fR
Specify the accounts of the jobs to view. Accepts a comma separated 
list of account names. This have no effect when listing job steps.

.TP

list can consist of user names or user id numbers.
