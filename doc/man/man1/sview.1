.SH "NAME"
.LP 
sview \- graphical user interface to view and modify SLURM state.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.LP 
sview

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
sview can be used to view SLURM configuration, job, 
step, node and partitions state information. 
Authorized users can also modify select information.
.LP
The primary display modes are \fIJobs\fR and \fIPartitions\fR, each with a selection tab.
There is also an optional map of the nodes on the left side of the window which 
will show the nodes associated with each job or partition.
Left\-click on the tab of the display you would like to see. 
Right\-click on the tab in order to control which fields will be displayed.
.LP
Within the display window, left\-click on the header to control the sort 
order of entries (e.g. increasing or decreasing) in the diplay.
You can also left\-click and drag the headers to move them right or left in the display.
If a JobID has an arrow next to it, click on that arrow to display or hide 
information about that job's steps. 
Right\-click on a line of the display to get more information about the record.
.LP
There is an \fIAdmin Mode\fR option which permits the user root to modify many of 
the fields displayed, such as node state or job time limit.
In the mode, a \fISLURM Reconfigure\fR Action is also available.
It is recommended that \fIAdmin Mode\fR be used only while modifications are 
actively being made. 
Disable \fIAdmin Mode\fR immediately after the changes to avoid possibly making 
unintended changes. 

.SH "NOTES"
The sview command can only be build if \fIgtk+\-2.0\fR is installed. 
Systems lacking these libraries will have SLURM installed without
the sview command.

On larger systems (2000+ nodes) some gtk themes can considerably slow down 
the grid display.  If you think this is happening you may
try defining SVIEW_GRID_SPEEDUP=1 in your environment.  This will use
a code path to try to avoid functions that typically take a
relatively large amount of time.  THIS OPTION DOESN'T WORK FOR EVERY
GTK THEME, but if it does work for your theme this provides an
outrageous amount of speedup.  We have found it to work very well with
QT based themes.
