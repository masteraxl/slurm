.TH SACCTMGR "1" "October 2008" "sacctmgr 1.3" "Slurm components"

.SH "NAME"
sacctmgr \- Used to view and modify Slurm account information.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsacctmgr\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] [\fICOMMAND\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsacctmgr\fR is used to view or modify Slurm account information.
The account information is maintained within a database with the interface 
being provided by \fBslurmdbd\fR (Slurm Database daemon).
This database can serve as a central storehouse of user and 
computer information for multiple computers at a single site.
Slurm account information is recorded based upon four parameters
that form what is referred to as an \fIassociation\fR. 
These parameters are \fIuser\fR, \fIcluster\fR, \fIpartition\fR, and 
\fIaccount\fR. \fIuser\fR is the login name.
\fIcluster\fR is the name of a Slurm managed cluster as specified by 
the \fIClusterName\fR parameter in the \fIslurm.conf\fR configuration file. 
\fIpartition\fR is the name of a Slurm partition on that cluster.
\fIaccount\fR is the bank account for a job.
The intended mode of operation is to initiate the \fBsacctmgr\fR command, 
add, delete, modify, and/or list \fIassociation\fR records then 
commit the changes and exit.

.SH "FLAT FILE DUMP AND LOAD"
sacctmgr has the capability to load and dump SLURM association data to and
from a file.  This method can easily add a new cluster or copy an
existing clusters associations into a new cluster with similar
accounts. Each file contains SLURM association data for a single
cluster.  Comments can be put into the file with the # character.
Each line of information must begin with one of the four titles; \fBCluster, Parent, Account or
User\fP. Following the title is a space, dash, space, entity value,
then specifications. Specifications are colon separated.  If any
variable such as Organization has a space in it surround the name with
single or double quotes.

To create a file of associations one can run

> sacctmgr dump tux file=tux.cfg
.br
(file=tux.cfg is optional)

To load a previously created file you can run

> sacctmgr load file=tux.cfg

Other options for load are \-

clean \- delete what was already there and start from scratch with this
information.
.br
Cluster= \- specify a different name for the cluster than that which is
in the file.

Quick explanation how the file works.

Since the associations in the system follow a hierarchy so does the
file.  Any thing that is a parent needs to be defined before any
children.  The only exception is the understood 'root' account.  This
is always a default for any cluster and does not need to be defined.

To edit/create a file start with a cluster line for the new cluster

\fBCluster\ \-\ cluster_name\fP

Followed by Accounts you want in this fashion...

\fBAccount\ \-\ cs:MaxNodesPerJob=5:MaxJobs=4:MaxProcSecondsPerJob=20:FairShare=399:MaxWallDurationPerJob=40:Description='Computer Science':Organization='LC'\fP

Any of the options after a ':' can be left out and they can be in any order.
If you want to add any sub accounts just list the Parent THAT HAS ALREADY 
BEEN CREATED before the account line in this fashion...

All account options are
.br
Description= \- a brief description of the account
.br
FairShare= \- to be used with a scheduler like MOAB to determine priority
.br
MaxJobs= \- maximum number of jobs the children of this account can run
.br
MaxNodesPerJob= \- maximum number of nodes per job the children of this
account can run
.br
MaxProcSecondsPerJob= \- maximum cpu seconds children of this accounts
jobs can run
.br
MaxWallDurationPerJob= \- maximum time (not related to job size)
children of this accounts jobs can run
.br
Organization= \- Name of organization that owns this account
.br
QOS= \- Comma separated list of Quality of Service names (Defined in sacctmgr)
.br

\fBParent\ \-\ cs
.br
Account\ \-\ test:MaxNodesPerJob=1:MaxJobs=1:MaxProcSecondsPerJob=1:FairShare=1:MaxWallDurationPerJob=1:Description='Test Account':Organization='Test'\fP

To add users to a account add a line like this after a Parent \- line

\fBUser\ \-\ lipari:MaxNodesPerJob=2:MaxJobs=3:MaxProcSecondsPerJob=4:FairShare=1:MaxWallDurationPerJob=1:AdminLevel=Operator:Coordinator='test'\fP

All user options are
.br
AdminLevel= \- Type of admin this user is (Administrator, Operator)
\fBMust be defined on the first occurrence of the user.\fP
.br
Coordinator= \- Comma separated list of accounts this user is
coordinator over \fBMust be defined on the first occurrence of the user.\fP
.br
DefaultAccount= \- system wide default account name
\fBMust be defined on the first occurrence of the user.\fP
.br
FairShare= \- to be used with a scheduler like MOAB to determine priority
.br
MaxJobs= \- maximum number of jobs this user can run
.br
MaxNodesPerJob= \- maximum number of nodes per job this user can run
.br
MaxProcSecondsPerJob= \- maximum cpu seconds this user can run per job
.br
MaxWallDurationPerJob= \- maximum time (not related to job size) this
user can run
.br
QOS= \- Comma separated list of Quality of Service names (Defined in sacctmgr)
\fBMust be defined on the first occurrence of the user.\fP
