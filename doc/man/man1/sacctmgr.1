.TH SACCTMGR "1" "October 2008" "sacctmgr 1.3" "Slurm components"

.SH "NAME"
sacctmgr \- Used to view and modify Slurm account information.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsacctmgr\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] [\fICOMMAND\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsacctmgr\fR is used to view or modify Slurm account information.
The account information is maintained within a database with the interface 
being provided by \fBslurmdbd\fR (Slurm Database daemon).
This database can serve as a central storehouse of user and 
computer information for multiple computers at a single site.
Slurm account information is recorded based upon four parameters
that form what is referred to as an \fIassociation\fR. 
These parameters are \fIuser\fR, \fIcluster\fR, \fIpartition\fR, and 
\fIaccount\fR. \fIuser\fR is the login name.
\fIcluster\fR is the name of a Slurm managed cluster as specified by 
the \fIClusterName\fR parameter in the \fIslurm.conf\fR configuration file. 
\fIpartition\fR is the name of a Slurm partition on that cluster.
\fIaccount\fR is the bank account for a job.
The intended mode of operation is to initiate the \fBsacctmgr\fR command, 
add, delete, modify, and/or list \fIassociation\fR records then 
commit the changes and exit.

.TP
\fIaccount\fP
A bank account, typically specified at job submit time using the 
\fI\-\-account=\fR option.

accounts \fIchemistry\fR and \fIphysics\fR may be children of
the account \fIscience\fR. 
The hierarchy may have an arbitrary depth.

file, used to differentiate accounts from on different machines. 

.TP
\fIcoordinator\fR

add users or sub accounts to the account they are coordinator over.

.SH "FLAT FILE DUMP AND LOAD"
sacctmgr has the capability to load and dump SLURM association data to and
from a file.  This method can easily add a new cluster or copy an
existing clusters associations into a new cluster with similar
accounts. Each file contains SLURM association data for a single
cluster.  Comments can be put into the file with the # character.
Each line of information must begin with one of the four titles; \fBCluster, Parent, Account or
User\fP. Following the title is a space, dash, space, entity value,
then specifications. Specifications are colon separated.  If any
variable such as Organization has a space in it surround the name with
single or double quotes.

To create a file of associations one can run

> sacctmgr dump tux file=tux.cfg
.br
(file=tux.cfg is optional)

To load a previously created file you can run

> sacctmgr load file=tux.cfg

Other options for load are \-

clean \- delete what was already there and start from scratch with this
information.
.br
Cluster= \- specify a different name for the cluster than that which is
in the file.

Quick explanation how the file works.

Since the associations in the system follow a hierarchy so does the
file.  Any thing that is a parent needs to be defined before any
children.  The only exception is the understood 'root' account.  This
is always a default for any cluster and does not need to be defined.

To edit/create a file start with a cluster line for the new cluster

\fBCluster\ \-\ cluster_name:MaxNodesPerJob=15\fP

Anything included on this line will be the defaults for all
associations on this cluster.  These options are as follows...

When modifying an object placing the key words 'set' and the
optional 'where' is crtical to perform correctly below are examples to
produce correct results.  As a rule of thumb any thing you put infront
of the set will be used as a quantifier.  If you want to put a
quantifier after the key word 'set' you should use the key
word 'where'.

wrong> sacctmgr modify user name=adam set fairshare=10 cluster=tux
.br

.br
This will produce an error as the above line reads modify user adam
set fairshare=10 and cluster=tux.  
.br

.br
right> sacctmgr modify user name=adam cluster=tux set fairshare=10
.br
right> sacctmgr modify user name=adam set fairshare=10 where cluster=tux

(For use with MOAB only)
When changing qos for something only use the '=' operator when wanting
to explitally set the qos to something.  In most cases you will want
to use the '+=' or '-=' operator to either add to or remove from the
existing qos already in place.
.br

.br
If a user already has qos of normal,standby for a parent or it was
explicitly set you should use qos+=expedite to add this to the list in
this fashon.
.br

.br
> sacctmgr modify user name=adam set qos+=expedite
.br

.br
If you are looking to only add the qos expedite to only a certain
accoun and or cluster you can do that by specifing them in the
sacctmgr line.
