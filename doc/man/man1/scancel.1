.TH SCANCEL "1" "December 2005" "scancel 1.0" "Slurm components"
.SH "NAME"
scancel \- Used to signal jobs or job steps that are under the control of Slurm.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBscancel\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] [\fIjob_id\fR[.\fIstep_id\fR]] [\fIjob_id\fR[.\fIstep_id\fR]...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBscancel\fR is used to signal or cancel jobs or job steps. An arbitrary number 
of jobs or job steps may be signaled using job specification filters or a
space separated list of specific job and/or job step IDs. A job or job step 
can only be signaled by the owner of that job or user root. If an attempt is 
made by an unauthorized user to signal a job or job step, an error message will 
be printed and the job will not be signaled. 
.TP

This option is incompatible with the \fB\-\-verbose\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-signal\fR=\fIsignal_name\fR
The name or number of the signal to be send. Default value is "KILL".

\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-state\fR=\fIjob_state_name\fR
The state of the jobs are to be signaled. \fIjob_state_name\fR may have a value of 
either "PENDING", "RUNNING" or "SUSPENDED".
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-user\fR=\fIuser_name\fR
The name of the user whose jobs are to be signaled.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR

.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-Version\fR
Print the version number of the scontrol command. 
.TP
ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIjob_id\fP
The Slurm job ID of the job to have one or more of its steps signaled.
.TP
\fIstep_id\fP
The step ID of the job step to be signaled. If none is provided and the 
\fB\-\-batch\fR option is not used, then all jobs steps associated with 
the provided job_id will be signaled.

.SH "NOTES"
.LP
If multiple filters are supplied (e.g. \fB\-\-partition\fR and \fB\-\-name\fR) only the 
jobs satisfying all of the filtering options will be signaled.
.LP
If a signal value of "KILL" (the default value) is to be sent to an entire job, this will 
result in the job's termination and its resource allocation being released.
.LP
Cancelling a job step will not result in a job being terminated. 
The job must be cancelled to release a resource allocation. 
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP
Send SIGTERM to steps 1 and 3 of job 1234:
scancel \-\-signal=TERM 1234.1 1234.3
.TP
Cancel job 1234 along with all of its steps:
scancel 1234
.TP
Cancel job all pending jobs belonging to user "bob" in partition "debug":
scancel \-\-state=PENDING \-\-user=bob \-\-partition=debug
