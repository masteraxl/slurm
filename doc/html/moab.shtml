<h1>Moab Cluster Suite Integration Guide</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Moab Cluster Suite configuration is quite complicated and is 
beyond the scope of any documents we could supply with SLURM.  
The best resource for Moab configuration information is the 
online documents at Cluster Resources Inc.: 
<a href="http://www.clusterresources.com/products/mwm/docs/slurmintegration.shtml">
http://www.clusterresources.com/products/mwm/docs/slurmintegration.shtml</a>.

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>First, download the Moab scheduler kit from their web site
<a href="http://www.clusterresources.com/pages/products/moab-cluster-suite.php">
http://www.clusterresources.com/pages/products/moab-cluster-suite.php</a>.<br> 
<b>Note:</b> Use Moab version 5.0.0 or higher and SLURM version 1.1.28 
or higher.</p>

<h3>SLURM configuration</h3>

<h4>slurm.conf</h4>
<p>Set the <i>slurm.conf</i> scheduler parameters as follows:</p>
<pre>
SchedulerType=sched/wiki2
SchedulerPort=7321
</pre>
<p>Running multiple jobs per mode can be accomplished using the
<i>Shared=yes</i> parameter on partitions.
The default value of <i>SchedulerPort</i> is 7321.
If the default port is used, <i>SchedulerPort</i> need not be specified.
The <i>SelectType=select/cons_res</i> parameter is not compatable
with the <i>sched/wiki</i> plugin (both would try to schedule the 
individual processors within a node).</p>

<a name="wiki.conf"><h4>wiki.conf</h4></a>
<p>SLURM's wiki configuration is stored in a file 
specific to the wiki-plugin named <i>wiki.conf</i>. 
This file should be protected from reading by users. 
It only needs to be readable by <i>SlurmUser</i> (as configured 
in <i>slurm.conf</i>) and only needs to exist on computers 
where the <i>slurmctld</i> daemon executes.
More information about wiki.conf is available in 
a man page distributed with SLURM.</p>

<p>The currently supported wiki.conf keywords include:</p>

<p><b>AuthKey</b> is a DES based encryption key used to sign 
communctions between SLURM and Maui or Moab. 
This use of this key is essential to insure that a user 
not build his own program to cancel other user's jobs in 
SLURM.
This should be a numeric value and match the the 
encryption key in Maui (<i>--with-key</i> on the 
configure line) or Moab (<i>KEY</i> parameter in the 
<i>moab-private.cfg</i> file). 
Note that SLURM's wiki plugin does not include a mechanism 
to submit new jobs, so even without this key nobody could 
run jobs as another user.</p>

<p><b>EPort</b> is an event notification port in Moab. 
When a job is submitted to or terminates in SLURM, 
Moab is sent a message on this port to begin an attempt
to schedule the computer.
This numeric value should match <i>EPORT</i> configured 
in the <i>moab.cnf</i> file.</p>

<p><b>EHost</b> is the event notification host for Moab.
This identifies the computer on which the Moab daemons 
executes which should be notified of events.</p>

<p><b>JobAggregationTime</b> is used to avoid notifying Moab 
of large numbers of events occuring about the same time.
If an event occurs within this number of seconds since Moab was
last notified of an event, another notification is not sent.
This should be an integer number of seconds.
The default value is 10 seconds.
The value should match <i>JOBAGGREGATIONTIME</i> configured 
in the <i>moab.cnf</i> file.</p>

<p><b>JobPriority</b> controls the scheduling of newly arriving 
jobs in SLURM. 
SLURM can either place all newly arriving jobs in a HELD state 
(priority = 0) and let Moab decide when and where to run the jobs 
or SLURM can control when and where to run jobs. 
In the later case, Moab can modify the priorities of pending jobs 
to re-order the job queue or just monitor system state.
Possible values are "hold" and "run" with "hold" being the default.</p> 

<p>Here is a sample <i>wiki.conf</i> file
<pre>
# wiki.conf
# SLURM's wiki plugin configuration file
#
# Matches KEY in moab-private.cfg
AuthKey=123456789
#
# Have Moab control job scheduling
JobPriority=hold
#
# Moab event notification port, matches EPORT in moab.cfg
EPort=15017
# Moab event notification host, where the Moab daemon runs
#EHost=tux0
#
# Moab event notifcation throttle, matches JOBAGGREGATIONTIME
# in moab.cfg (integer value in seconds)
JobAggregationTime=15
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Moab Configuration</h3>

<p>Moab has support for SLURM's WIKI interface by default.
Specify this interface in the <i>moab.cfg</i> file as follows:</p>
<pre>
SCHEDCFG[base]       MODE=NORMAL
RMCFG[slurm]         TYPE=WIKI:SLURM AUTHTYPE=CHECKSUM
</pre>
<p>In <i>moab-private.cfg</i> specify the private key as follows:</p>
<pre>
CLIENTCFG[RM:slurm] KEY=123456789
</pre>
<p>Insure that this file is protected from viewing by users. </p>
