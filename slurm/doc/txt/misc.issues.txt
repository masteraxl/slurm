Requirements Discussion 12/25/2001, Chris, Jim, Py Watson:
- Atomic needed for DPCS willrun - schedule - run operations.
- schedule debug windows (ratchet down limits) / include interactive
- burst over limits when nodes available but mark jobs as killable
- haiku error messages (see perl module)
- speed
- no core by default, core "lite", overrideable, core.hostname.pid,
  core directory to avoid contention no creating directory
- preemption (SIGSTOP job in the way), EINTR issues, mark "non-preemptable"
- checkpoint/restart
- refer to purple RFP comments on batch systems

Meeting 1/4/2001, Moe, Mark G., Jim, Chris:
- Elan needs contiguous nodes for hardware broadcast; achieving this
  is incompatible with DPCS's scheduling algorithm.  RMS uses box packing.
- Need DPCS constraint for contiguous nodes, passed in with willrun query.
