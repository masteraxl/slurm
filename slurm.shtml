<h2>SLURM: A Highly Scalable Resource Manager</h2>
<p>SLURM is an open-source resource manager designed for Linux clusters of all 
sizes. It provides three key functions. First it allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive 
access to resources (computer nodes) to users for some duration of time so they 
can perform work. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and 
monitoring work (typically a parallel job) on a set of allocated nodes. Finally, 
it arbitrates conflicting requests for resources by managing a queue of pending 
work. </p>

<p>SLURM is not a sophisticated batch system, but it does provide an Applications 
Programming Interface (API) for integration with external schedulers such as 
<a href="http://supercluster.org/maui">The Maui Scheduler</a>. 
While other resource managers do exist, SLURM is unique in several respects: 
<ul>
<li>Its source code is freely available under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>.</li>
<li>It is designed to operate in a heterogeneous cluster with up to 16,384 nodes.</li>
<li>It is portable; written in C with a GNU autoconf configuration engine. While 
initially written for Linux, other UNIX-like operating systems should be easy 
porting targets. A plugin mechanism exists to support various interconnects, authentication 
mechanisms, schedulers, etc.</li>
<li>SLURM is highly tolerant of system failures, including failure of the node 
executing its control functions.</li>
<li>It is simple enough for the motivated end user to understand its source and 
add functionality.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>SLURM provides resource management on about 1000 computers world-wide including 
many of the most powerful computers in the world including:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.llnl.gov/asci/platforms/bluegenel/">BlueGene/L</a> with 65,536
dual-processor compute nodes</li>
<li><a href="http://www.llnl.gov/linux/thunder/">Thunder</a> a Linux cluster with 1024 nodes 
each having four Itanium2 processors</li>
<li><a href="http://www.llnl.gov/asci/platforms/purple/">ASC Purple</a> an IBM SP/AIX cluster 
with about 1500 nodes each having eight Power5 processors</li>
</ul>
