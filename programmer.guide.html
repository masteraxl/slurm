<h1>SLURM Programmer's Guide</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is an open source,
fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job 
scheduling system for Linux clusters of 
thousands of nodes.  Components include machine status, partition
management, job management, and scheduling modules.  The design also 
includes a scalable, general-purpose communication infrastructure.
SLURM requires no kernel modifications and is relatively self-contained.

<h2>Components</h2>
The <b>Job Initiator</b> (JI) is the tool used by the customer to initiate 
a job. The job initiator can execute on any computer in the cluser. Its 
request is sent to the <b>controller</b> executing on the <b>control machine</b>. 
<p>
The controller (<b>ControlDaemon</b>) orchestrates all SLURM activities including: accepting the 
job initiation request, allocating nodes to the job, enforcing partition
constraints, enforcing job limits, and general record keeping. The three 
primary components (threads) of the controller are the <b>Partition Manager</b> (PM), 
<b>Node Manager</b> (NM), and <b>Job Manager</b> (JM). The partition manager
keeps track of partition state and contraints. The node manager keeps track 
of node state and configuration. The job manager keeps track of job state 
and enforces its limits. Since all of these functions are critical to the 
overall SLURM operation, a <b>backup controler</b> assumes thsse responsibilities
in the event of control machine failure.
<p>
The final component of interest is the <b>Job Shepherd</b> (JS), which is 
part of the <b>ServerDaemon</b>. The ServerDaemon executes on every SLURM 
compute server.  The job shepherd initiates 
the job's tasks. It allocates switch resources. It also monitors job 
state and resources utilization. Finally, it delivers signals to the 
processes as needed.

<p>
Interconnecting all of these components is a highly scalable and reliable 
communications library. The general mode of operation is for each every 
node to initiate <b>MasterDaemon</b>. This daemon will in turn 
execute any defined <b>InitProgram</b> to insure the node is fully ready 
for service. MasterDaemon will subsequently initiate <b>ControlDaemon</b>
and/or <b>ServerDaemon</b> as defined in the SLURM configuration file 
and terminate itself.
<p>
The ControlDaemon will read the node and partition information from 
the appropriate SLURM configuration files. It will then contact each 
ServerDaemon to gather current job and system state information. 
The <b>BackupController</b> will ping the ControlDaemon periodically 
to insure that it is operative. If the ControlDaemon failes to respond 
for a period specified as <b>ControllerTimeout</b>, the BackupController
will assume those responsibilities. The original ControlDaemon will 
re-assume those responsibilities when returned to service. 
Whenever the machine responsible for control responsibilities changes, 
it must notify every other SLURM daemon to insure that messages are 
routed in an appropriate fashion.
<p>
The Job Initiator will contact the ControlDaemon in order to be allocated 
appropriate resources as possible, including authorization for 
interconnect use. The Job Initiator itself will be responsible 
for distributing the program, environment variables, identification of 
the current directory, standard input, etc. Standard output and standard 
error from the program will be transmitted to the Job Initiator. Should 
the Job Initiator terminate prior to the parallel job's termination 
(for example, if the node fails), the ControlDaemon will initiate a 
new Job Initiator. While the new Job Initiator will not be capable of 
transmitting additional standard input data, it will log the standard 
output and error data.
<p>
ServerDaemon's Job Shepherd will initiate the user program's tasks 
and monitor their state. The ServerDaemon will also monitor and report 
overall node state information periodically to the ControlDaemon. 
Should any node associated with a user task fail (ServerDaemon 
fails to respond within <b>ServerTimeout<b>), the entire application 
will be terminated by the Job Initiator.

<h2>Communications Summary</h2>
BackupController pings ControlDaemon periodically and assumes 
control after ControllerTimeout. When there is a change in the 
node on which the ControlDaemon executes, all SLURM daemons are 
notified in order to route their messages appropriately.
<p>
ControlDaemon collects state information from ServerDaemon. If there 
have been no communcations for a while, it pings the ServerDaemon. 
If there is no response within ServerTimeout, the node is considered 
DOWN and unavailable for use. The appropriate Job Initiator is also 
notified in order to terminate the job. The ControlDaemon also processes 
administrator and user requests.
<p>
The ServerDaemon wait for work requests from the Job Initiators. 
It spawns user tasks as required. It transfers standard input, output 
and error as required. It reports job and system state information 
as requested by the Job Initiator and ControlDaemon.

<h2>Authentication and Authorization</h2>
TBD

<h2>Code Modules</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Controller.c
<dd> Primary SLURM daemon to execute on control machine. 
It manages the Partition Manager, Node Manager, and Job Manager threads.
<dt>Get_Mach_Stat.c
<dd>Module gets the machine's status and configuration. 
This includes: operating system version, size of real memory, size 
of virtual memory, size of /tmp disk storage, number of processors, 
and speed of processors. This is a module of the Job Shepherd component.
<dt>list.c
<dd>Module is a general purpose list manager. One can define a 
list, add and delete entries, search for entries, etc. This module 
is used by multiple SLURM components.
<dt>list.h
<dd>Module contains definitions for list.c and documentation for its functions.
<dt>Mach_Stat_Mgr.c
<dd>Module reads, writes, records, updates, and otherwise 
manages the state information for all nodes (machines) in the 
cluster managed by SLURM. This module performs much of the Node Manager 
component functionality.
<dt>Partition_Mgr.c
<dd>Module reads, writes, records, updates, and otherwise 
manages the state information associated with partitions in the 
cluster managed by SLURM. This module is the Partition Manager component.
<dt>Read_Config.c
<dd>Module reads overall SLURM configuration file.
<dt>Read_Proc.c
<dd>Module reads system process table state. Used to determine job state 
including resource usage.
<dt>Slurm_Admin.c
<dd>Administration tool for reading, writing, and updating SLURM configuration.
</dl>

<h2>Design Issues</h2>
Most modules are constructed with a some simple, built-in tests. 
Set declarations for DEBUG_MODULE and DEBUG_SYSTEM  both to 1 near 
the top of the module's code. Then compile and run the test. 
Required input scripts and configuration files for these tests 
will be kept in the "etc" subdirectory and the commands to execute 
the tests are in the "Makefile". In some cases, the module must 
be loaded with some other components. In those cases, the support 
modules should be built with the declaration for DEBUG_MODULE set 
to 0 and for DEBUG_SYSTEM set to 1.
<p>
Many of these modules have been built and tested on a variety of 
Unix computers including Redhat's Linux, IBM's AIX, Sun's Solaris, 
and Compaq's Tru-64. The only module at this time which is operating 
system dependent is Get_Mach_Stat.c.
<p>
The node selection logic allocates nodes to jobs in a fashion which 
makes most sense for a Quadrics switch interconnect. It allocates 
the smallest collection of consecutive nodes that satisfies the 
request (e.g. if there are 32 consecutive nodes and 16 consecutive 
nodes available, a job needing 16 or fewer nodes will be allocated 
those nodes from the 16 node set rather than fragment the 32 node 
set). If the job can not be allocated consecutive nodes, it will 
be allocated the smallest number of consecutive sets (e.g. if there 
are sets of available consecutive nodes of sizes 6, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 
and 1 then a request for 10 nodes will always be allocated the 6 
and 4 node sets rather than use the smaller sets).
<p>
We have tried to develop the SLURM code to be quite general and
flexible, but compromises were made in several areas for the sake of 
simplicity and ease of support. Entire nodes are dedicated to user 
applications. Our customers at LLNL have expressed the opinion that sharing of 
nodes can severely reduce their job's performance and even reliability. 
This is due to contention for shared resources such as local disk space, 
real memory, virtual memory and processor cycles. The proper support of 
shared resources, including the enforcement of limits on these resources, 
entails a substantial amount of additional effort. Given such a cost to 
benefit situation at LLNL, we have decided to not support shared nodes. 
However, we have designed SLURM so as to not preclude the addition of 
such a capability at a later time if so desired.

<h2>To Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>We need to build up a reasonable Makefile.</li>
<li>How do we interface with TotalView</li>
</ul>
