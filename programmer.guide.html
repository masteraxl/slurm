<h1>SLURM Programmer's Guide</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is an open source,
fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job 
scheduling system for Linux clusters of 
thousands of nodes.  Components include machine status, partition
management, job management, and scheduling modules.  The design also 
includes a scalable, general-purpose communication infrastructure.
SLURM requires no kernel modifications and is relatively self-contained.

<h2>Components</h2>
<b>config.h</b> is just used to define "out_of_memory" for list.c.
<p>
<b>errors.h</b> is needed for config.h
<p>
<b>Get_Mach_Stat.c</b> gets the machine's status and configuration. 
This includes: operating system version, size of real memory, size 
of virtual memory, size of /tmp disk storage, number of processors, 
and speed of processors.
<p>
<b>list.c</b> is a general purpose list manager. One can define a 
list, add and delete entries, search for entries, etc.
<p>
<b>list.h</b> contains definitions for list.c and documentation for 
its functions.
<p>
<b>Mach_Stat_Mgr.c</b> reads, writes, records, updates, and otherwise 
manages the state information for all nodes (machines) in the 
cluster managed by SLURM.
<p>
<b>Partition_Mgr.c</b> reads, writes, records, updates, and otherwise 
manages the state information associated with partitions in the 
cluster managed by SLURM.

<h2>Design Issues</h2>
Most modules are constructed with a some simple, built-in tests. 
Set declarations for DEBUG_MODULE and DEBUG_SYSTEM  both to 1 near 
the top of the module's code. Then compile and run the test. 
Required input scripts and configuration files for these tests 
will be kept in the "etc" subdirectory and the commands to execute 
the tests are in the "Makefile". In some cases, the module must 
be loaded with some other components. In those cases, the support 
modules should be built with the declaration for DEBUG_MODULE set 
to 0 and for DEBUG_SYSTEM set to 1.
<p>
Many of these modules have been built and tested on a variety of 
Unix computers including Redhat's Linux, IBM's AIX, Sun's Solaris, 
and Compaq's Tru-64. The only module at this time which is operating 
system dependent is Get_Mach_Stat.c.
<p>
We have tried to develop the SLURM code to be quite general and
flexible, but compromises were made in several areas for the sake of 
simplicity and ease of support. Entire nodes are dedicated to user 
applications. Our customers at LLNL have expressed the opinion that sharing of 
nodes can severely reduce their job's performance and even reliability. 
This is due to contention for shared resources such as local disk space, 
real memory, virtual memory and processor cycles. The proper support of 
shared resources, including the enforcement of limits on these resources, 
entails a substantial amount of additional effort. Given such a cost to 
benefit situation at LLNL, we have decided to not support shared nodes. 
However, we have designed SLURM so as to not preclude the addition of 
such a capability at a later time if so desired.

<h2>To Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>We probably want to move into list.h only what is need from config.h and errors.h.</li>
<li>We need to build up a reasonable Makefile.</li>
<li>The node selection process for contiguous nodes in Controller.c selects 
the first fit. Best fit would probably be better. For now, 
higher-level scheduler will insure that no job suffers from starvation.</li>
</ul>
