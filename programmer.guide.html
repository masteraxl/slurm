<h1>SLURM Programmer's Guide</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is an open source,
fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job 
scheduling system for Linux clusters of 
thousands of nodes.  Components include machine status, partition
management, job management, and scheduling modules.  The design also 
includes a scalable, general-purpose communication infrastructure.
SLURM requires no kernel modifications and is relatively self-contained.

<h2>Overview</h2>
There is a description of the components and their interactions available 
in a separate document, <a href="overview.ps">SLURM: Simple Linux Utility 
for Resource Management</a>.

<p>Code should adhere to the Linux kernel code style as described in
<a href="http://www.linuxhq.com/kernel/v2.4/doc/CodingStyle.html">
http://www.linuxhq.com/kernel/v2.4/doc/CodingStyle.html</a>.

<h2> API Modules</h2>
This directory contains modules supporting the SLURM API functions.

<dl>
<dt>allocate.c
<dd>API to allocate resources for a job's initiation.

<dt>build_info.c
<dd>API to report SLURM build parameter values.

<dt>node_info.c
<dd>API to report node state and configuration values.

<dt>partition_info.c
<dd>API to report partition state and configuration values.

<dt>reconfigure.c
<dd>API to request that slurmctld reload configuration information.

<dt>update_config.c
<dd>API to update job, node or partition state information.
</dl>

<h2>Common Modules</h2>
This directory contains modules of general use throughout the SLURM code. 
The modules are described below.

<dl>
<dt>bits_bytes.c
<dd>A collection of functions for processing bit maps and strings for parsing.

<dt>list.c
<dd>Module is a general purpose list manager. One can define a 
list, add and delete entries, search for entries, etc. 

<dt>list.h
<dd>Module contains definitions for list.c and documentation for its functions.

<dt>slurm.h
<dd>Definitions for common SLURM data structures and functions.

<dt>slurmlib.h
<dd>Definitions for SLURM API data structures and functions.
</dl>


<h2>scancel Modules</h2>
scancel is a command to cancel running or pending jobs.

<dl>
<dt>scancel.c
<dd>A command line interface to cancel jobs.
</dl>


<h2>scontrol Modules</h2>
scontrol is the administrator tool for monitoring and modifying SLURM configuration 
and state. It has a command line interface only

<dl>
<dt>scontrol.c
<dd>A command line interface to slurmctld.
</dl>


<h2>slurmctld Modules</h2>
slurmctld executes on the control machine and orchestrates SLURM activities 
across the entire cluster including monitoring node and partition state, 
scheduling, job queue management, job dispatching, and switch management. 
The slurmctld modules and their functionality are described below.

<dl>
<dt>controller.c
<dd>Primary SLURM daemon to execute on control machine. 
It manages communications the Partition Manager, Switch Manager, and Job Manager threads.

<dt>node_mgr.c
<dd>Module reads, writes, records, updates, and otherwise 
manages the state information for all nodes (machines) in the 
cluster managed by SLURM. 

<dt>node_scheduler.c
<dd>Selects the nodes to be allocated to pending jobs. This makes extensive use 
of bit maps in representing the nodes. It also considers the locality of nodes 
to improve communications performance.

<dt>partition_mgr.c
<dd>Module reads, writes, records, updates, and otherwise 
manages the state information associated with partitions in the 
cluster managed by SLURM. 

<dt>read_config.c
<dd>Read the SLURM configuration file and use it to build node and 
partition data structures.
</dl>


<h2>slurmd Modules</h2>
slurmd executes on each compute node. It initiates and terminates user 
jobs and monitors both system and job state. The slurmd modules and their 
functionality are described below.

<dl>
<dt>get_mach_stat.c
<dd>This module gets the machine's status and configuration. 
This includes: size of real memory, size of temporary disk storage, and 
the number of processors.

<dt>read_proc.c
<dd>This module collects job state information including real memory use, 
virtual memory use, and CPU time use.
</dl>

<h2>Design Issues</h2>
Most modules are constructed with a some simple, built-in tests. 
Set declarations for DEBUG_MODULE and DEBUG_SYSTEM  both to 1 near 
the top of the module's code. Then compile and run the test. 
Required input scripts and configuration files for these tests 
will be kept in the "etc" subdirectory and the commands to execute 
the tests are in the "Makefile". In some cases, the module must 
be loaded with some other components. In those cases, the support 
modules should be built with the declaration for DEBUG_MODULE set 
to 0 and for DEBUG_SYSTEM set to 1.
<p>
Many of these modules have been built and tested on a variety of 
Unix computers including Redhat's Linux, IBM's AIX, Sun's Solaris, 
and Compaq's Tru-64. The only module at this time which is operating 
system dependent is get_mach_stat.c.
<p>
The node selection logic allocates nodes to jobs in a fashion which 
makes most sense for a Quadrics switch interconnect. It allocates 
the smallest collection of consecutive nodes that satisfies the 
request (e.g. if there are 32 consecutive nodes and 16 consecutive 
nodes available, a job needing 16 or fewer nodes will be allocated 
those nodes from the 16 node set rather than fragment the 32 node 
set). If the job can not be allocated consecutive nodes, it will 
be allocated the smallest number of consecutive sets (e.g. if there 
are sets of available consecutive nodes of sizes 6, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 
and 1 then a request for 10 nodes will always be allocated the 6 
and 4 node sets rather than use the smaller sets).
