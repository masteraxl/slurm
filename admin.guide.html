<h1>SLURM Administrator's Guide</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is an open source,
fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job 
scheduling system for Linux clusters of 
thousands of nodes.  Components include machine status, partition
management, job management, and scheduling modules.  The design also 
includes a scalable, general-purpose communication infrastructure.
SLURM requires no kernel modifications and is relatively self-contained.

<h2>Configuration</h2>
There are three SLURM configuration files that you need to establish: 
overall SLURM options, node configurations, and partition configuration. 
The overall SLURM configuration options indicate where to find the 
other configuration files, where to find the daemons, how often to 
perform certain actions, etc. The node configuration tell SLURM 
what nodes it is to manage as well as their anticipated hardware 
and system software configurations. The partition configuration 
permits you to establish different job limits or access lists for 
various groups (or partitions) of nodes. 

<h3>Overall SLURM Configuration</h3>
The overall SLURM configuration file contents have yet to be 
established. Moe Jette to document later

<h3>Node Configuration</h3>
The node configuration permits you to identify the nodes (or machines) 
to be managed by SLURM. You may identify the hardware and/or software 
characteristics of the node in the configuration file. SLURM operates 
in a heterogeneous environment and users are able to specify resource 
requirements to achieve the desired scheduling characteristics. 
Note that some of these values are not appropriate for you to 
set and this will be described in detail below.
The partiton configuration file contains the following information: 
<dl>
<dt>Name
<dd>Name of a node as returned by hostname (e.g. "lx12").
<dt>Partition
<dd>List of partition numbers this node belongs to, partition numbers 
range from 0 to 31 and are specified with comma separators (e.g. "1,3").
This can be altered by resetting MAX_PARTITION in the slurm.h file 
before building. In no case should this value exceed the number of 
bits in an integer on the computer as a bit-mask is used to record 
partition information. The default partition value is zero.
<dt>OS
<dd>Operating System name and level (output of the command
"/bin/uname -s -r | /bin/sed 's/ /./g'", e.g. "Linux.2.4.7-10"). 
The default value is "UNKNOWN"
<dt>CPUs
<dd>Number of processors on the node (e.g. "2"). The default 
value is 1.
<dt>Speed
<dd>Relative speed of these processors. Units can be an arbitrary 
floating point number, but MHz value is recommended (e.g. "863.8").
The default value is 1.
<dt>RealMemory
<dd>Size of real memory on the node in MegaBytes (e.g. "2048").
The default value is 1.
<dt>VirtualMemory
<dd>Size of virtual memory on the node in MegaBytes (e.g. "4096").
The default value is 1.
<dt>TmpDisk
<dd>Total size of temporary disk storage on "/tmp" in MegaBytes 
(e.g. "16384"). Note this does not indicate the amount of free 
space available to the user on the node, only the total file 
The default value is 1.
system size. 
<dt>LastResponse
<dd>Time of last contact from node, format is time_t as returned 
by the "time" function. The default value is 0.
<dt>State
<dd>State of the node. Acceptable values are "UNKNOWN", "IDLE", 
"BUSY", "DOWN", "DRAINED", "DRAINING". 
The default value is "UNKNOWN".
</dl>

<p>
Only the Name must be supplied in the configuration file; all other 
items are optional.
If you operate with more than one partition, Partition should also 
be specified. 
Other configuration information can be established through communications 
with the SLURM Daemon, slurmd actually running on each node.
ALternately, you can explicitly establish baseline values in the 
configuration file. 
Nodes which register to the system with less than the configured resources 
(e.g. too little memory), will be placed in the "DRAINED" state to 
avoid scheduling jobs on them.
By default all nodes will be in partition zero, but it is possible 
to configure your system with multiple overlapping partitions (more 
on that below).
If a node is not to be included in any partition, indicate this with the 
expression "Partition= ".
Lines in the configuration file having "#" in column one will be 
considered comments.
The configuration file should contain information about one node on 
a single line. 
If more than one line is used to describe a node's configuration, 
be sure to include "Name=" on each line.
In the interest of simplicity (for the developers), the field 
descriptors above are case sensitive. 
Each field should contain the field's name, an equal sign, and the value. 
Fields should be space or tab separated.
The default values for each node can be specified with a record in which 
"Name" is "DEFAULT". 
The default entry values will apply only to lines following it in the 
configuration file and the default values can be reset multiple times 
in the configuration file with multiple entries where "Name=DEFAULT".
In order to support the concept of jobs requiring consecutive nodes, 
nodes should be place in this file in consecutive order.
The size of any field in the configuration file is limited to 1024 characters.
A <a href="#SampleNode">sample node configuration file</a> is included at the end of this document.

<h3>Partition Configuration</h3>
The partition configuration permits you to establish different job 
limits or access lists for various groups (or partitions) of nodes. 
Nodes may be in more than one partition. The partiton configuration 
file contains the following information: 
<dl>
<dt>Name
<dd>Name by which the partition may be referenced (e.g. "Interactive"). 
This name can be used by users when submitting their jobs.
<dt>Number
<dd>Unique number by which the partition can be referenced. This is 
used in the node configuration file.
<dt>JobType
<dd>Job types which may execute in the partition. Possible values 
are "BATCH", "INTERACTIVE", and "ALL". The default value is "ALL".
<dt>MaxTime
<dd>Maximum wall-time limit for any job in minutes. The default 
value is "UNLIMITED", which is represented internally as -1.
<dt>MaxCpus
<dd>Maximum count of CPUs which may be allocated to any single job,
The default value is "UNLIMITED", which is represented internally as -1.
<dt>State
<dd>State of partition or availability for use.  Possible values 
are "UP" or "DOWN". The default value is "UP".
<dt>AllowUsers
<dd>Names of user who may use the partition, separated by commas. 
The default value is "ALL". If AllowUsers is specified, then 
the value of DenyUsers will be ignored.
<dt>DenyUsers
<dd>Names of user who may not use the partition, separated by commas.
The  default value is "NONE".
</dl>

<p>
Only the first two items, Name and Number, must be supplied in the 
configuration file.
If not otherwise specified, all nodes will be in partition zero.
Lines in the configuration file having "#" in the first collumn 
will be considered comments.
It is recommended that configuration file contain information 
about one partition per line. If more than one line is used to 
describe the configuration of a partition, specify the "Name=" 
on each line.
In the interest of simplicity (for the developers), the field 
descriptors above are case sensitive. 
Each field should contain the field's name, an equal sign, and the value. 
Fields should be space or tab separated.
The default values for each partition can be specified with a record in which 
"Name" is "DEFAULT" if other default values are desired. 
The default entry values will apply only to lines following it in the 
configuration file and the default values can be reset multiple times 
in the configuration file with multiple entries where "Name=DEFAULT".
The size of any field in the configuration file is limited to 1024 characters.
If user controls are desired then set either AllowUsers or DenyUsers, but not both.
If AllowUsers is set, then DenyUsers is ignored. 
A <a href="#SamplePart">sample partition configuration file</a> is included at the end of this document.

<h3>Job Configuration</h3>
The job configuration format specified below is used for the SLURM daemons 
to save state information. The format specified below is also used by the 
slurm_admin administration tool to modify job state information: 
<dl>
<dt>Number
<dd>Unique number by which the job can be referenced. This value 
may not be changed by slurm_admin.
<dt>Name
<dd>Name by which the job may be referenced (e.g. "Simulation"). 
This name can be specified by users when submitting their jobs.
<dt>JobType
<dd>Permitted job types values are "BATCH" and "INTERACTIVE". 
<dt>MaxTime
<dd>Maximum wall-time limit for the job in minutes. An "UNLIMITED"
value is represented internally as -1.
<dt>Nodes
<dd>Comma separated list of nodes which are allocated to the job. 
This value may not be changed by slurm_admin.
<dt>State
<dd>State of the job.  Possible values are "PENDING", "STARTING", 
"RUNNING", and "ENDING". 
<dt>User
<dd>Name of the user executing this job.
</dl>

<h2>Slurm_admin Administration Tool</h2>
The tool you will primarily use in the administration of SLURM is slurm_admin. 
It provides the means of viewing and updating node and partition 
configurations. It can also be used to update some job state 
information. You can execute slurm_admin with a single keyword on 
the execute line or it will query you for input and process those 
keywords on an interactive basis. The slurm_admin keywords are shown below.
A <a href="#SampleAdmin">sample slurm_admin session</a> with examples is appended.

<p>
Usage: slurm_admin [-q] [-v] [&lt;keyword&gt;]<br>
-q is equivalent to the "quiet" keyword<br>
-v is equivalent to the "verbose" keyword<br>
</pre>
<dl>
<dt>exit
<dd>Terminate slurm_admin.
<dt>help
<dd>Display this list of slurm_admin commands and options.
<dt>quiet
<dd>Print no messages other than error messages.
<dt>quit
<dd>Terminate slurm_admin.
<dt>reconfigure &lt;NodeName&gt;
<dd>The SLURM daemons on the specified node are instructed to re-read 
the configuration files. The default is that all daemons on all nodes 
are reconfigured.
<dt>restart &lt;NodeName&gt;
<dd>The SLURM daemons on the specified node are stopped and restarted. 
The default is that all daemons on all nodes are stopped and restarted. 
All state information for the daemons are preserved.
<dt>show &lt;entity&gt; &lt;ID&gt;
<dd>Show the configuration for a given entity. Entity must 
be "job", "node", or "partition". By default, state information 
for all records is reported. If you only wish to see the 
state of one entity record, specify either its ID number
(assumed if entirely numberic) or its name. 
<dt>start &lt;NodeName&gt;
<dd>The SLURM daemons on the specified node are started as needed. 
The default is that all daemons on all nodes are started.
<dt>stop &lt;NodeName&gt;
<dd>The SLURM daemons on the specified node are stopped. 
The default is that all daemons on all nodes are stopped. 
All state information for the daemons are preserved for 
whenever the daemons are restarted. Note this will <b>not</b> 
terminate any job executing on the node. You may set a 
node's state to "DRAINING", set any running job's state to 
"ENDING", wait for the job to terminate, then stop the 
daemon on a node to leave no active jobs.
<dt>update &lt;entity&gt; &lt;options&gt;
<dd>Update the configuration for a given entity. Entity 
must be "job", "node", or "partition". Options are of the same 
format as the configuration files. 
<dt>verbose
<dd>Enable detailed logging of slurm_admin execution state information.
<dt>version
<dd>Display the slurm_admin tool version number.
</dl>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
It is advisable to start the ControlMachine before any other 
of the cluster's nodes.
There is no necessity for synchronized clocks on the nodes.
The hierarchical communications provides excellent scalability.
Fault-tolerance will be built through mechanisms to save 
and restore the database using local and global file systems.
