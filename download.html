<h1>SLURM: Download</h1>

We expect to post SLURM for download when version 0.3 
is completed and tested in the first quarter of 2003.
However, we will provide the code upon request (notify  
<a href="mailto:jette@llnl.gov">jette@llnl.gov</a>). 
The available components include:
<dl>
<dt><b>Source code</b>
<dd>Includes the code for all SLURM daemons, commands and libraries.
Man pages and other documents are included.
<dt><b>Test suite</b>
<dd>Includes a collection of about 100 functionality and stress tests 
for SLURM. 
Approximately 1000 SLURM jobs will be executed by this test suite. 
Total execution time will vary by system type, but be on the order 
of 40 minutes.
<dt><b>PAM module</b>
<dd>Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) for restricting access to 
compute nodes where SLURM performs resource management.  
Access to the node is restricted to user root and users who have 
been allocated resources on that node
<dt><b>MPICH patch</b>
<dd>MPICH normally uses the <b>rsh</b> program to initiate tasks. 
Since these processes are not directly under the control of SLURM 
daemons, SLURM functionality is restricted. 
For example, SLURM has not reliable means of determining which processes 
are associated with a given job. 
This patch improves the integration of SLURM and MPICH.
