<h1>SLURM: What's New</h1>

<h2>Major Updates in SLURM Version 0.3</h2>
<p>We expect to make SLURM Version 0.3 available in the first 
quarter of 2004. Major enhancements include: 
<ul>
<li>Scheduler plugin developed for backfill scheduling and 
<a href="http://supercluster.org/maui">The Maui Scheduler</a>.</li>
<li>I/O streams for all tasks on a node are transmitted through one pair of 
sockets instead of distinct sockets for each task. This improves performance 
and scalability.</li>
<li>Support for <a href="http://www.lam-mpi.org/">LAM/MPI</a> is provided.</li>
<li>The interconnect/switch logic has been moved to a plugin.</li>
<li>Load-leveling performed to distribute workload across shared nodes.</li>
<li>Job completion plugin developed to log job details.</li>
<li>The <i>srun</i> command properly handles job step termination upon 
node failure.</li>
<li>All commands will re-read the slurm configuration file when changed.</li>
<li>An arbitrary signal may be sent to a batch script (and not its processes).</li>
<li>Batch scripts can have arguments that are propagated.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>For a complete list of enhancements in SLURM version 0.3, please see
