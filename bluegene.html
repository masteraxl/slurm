<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This document describes the unique features of SLURM on the
<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/bluegene">IBM Blue Gene</a> systems. 
You should be familiar with the SLURM's mode of operation on Linux clusters 
before studying the relatively few differences in Blue Gene operation 
described in this document.</p>

<p>Blue Gene systems have several unique features making for a few 
differences in how SLURM operates there. 
The basic unit of resource allocation is a <i>base partition</i>.
The <i>base partitions</i> are connected in a three-dimensional torus. 
Each <i>base partition</i> includes 512 <i>c-nodes</i> each containing two processors; 
one designed primarily for computations and the other primarily for managing communications. 
SLURM considers each <i>base partition</i> as one node with 1024 processors. 
The <i>c-nodes</i> can execute only one process and thus are unable to execute both 
the user's jobs and SLURM's <i>slurmd</i> daemon.
Thus the <i>slurmd</i> daemon executes on one of the Blue Gene <i>Front End Nodes</i>. 
This <i>slurmd</i> daemon provides (almost) all of the normal SLURM services 
for every <i>base partition</i> on the system. </p>

<h3>User Tools</h3>

<p>The normal set of SLURM user tools: srun, scancel, sinfo, squeue and scontrol 
provide all of the expected services except support for job steps. 
SLURM performs resource allocation for the job, but initiation of tasks is performed 
using the <i>mpirun</i> command. SLURM has no concept of a job step on Blue Gene.
Four new srun options are available: 
<i>--geometry</i> (specify job size in each dimension),
<i>--no-rotate</i> (disable rotation of geometry), 
<i>--conn-type</i> (specify interconnect type between base partitions, mesh or torus), and 
<i>--node-use</i> (specify how second processor on each c-node is to be used, 
coprocessor or virual).
You can also continue to use the <i>--nodes</i> option with a minimum and (optionally) 
maximum node count. The <i>--ntasks</i> option continues to be supported. 
See the srun man pages for details. </p>

<a name="naming">
<p>The naming of nodes includes a three-digit suffix representing the base partition's 
location in the X, Y and Z dimensions with a zero origin.
For example, "bgl012" represents the base partition whose location is at X=0, Y=1 and Z=2. 
Since jobs must be allocated consecutive nodes in all three dimensions, we have developed 
an abbreviated format for describing the nodes in one of these three-dimensional blocks. 
The node's prefix is followed by the end-points of the block enclosed in square-brackets. 
For example, " bgl[620x731]" is used to represent the eight nodes enclosed in a block 
with endpoints bgl620 and bgl731 (bgl620, bgl621, bgl630, bgl631, bgl720, bgl721, 
bgl730 and bgl731).</p></a>

<p>One new tools provided is <i>smap</i>.
Smap is aware of system topography and provides a map of what nodes are allocated 
to jobs, partitions, etc. 
See the smap man page for details.
A sample of smap output is provided below showing the location of five jobs. 
Note the format of the list of nodes allocated to each job.
Also note that idle (unassigned) base partitions are indicated by a period.
Down and drained base partitions (those not available for use) are 
indicated by a number sign (bgl703 in the display below).
The legend is for illustrative purposes only. 
The origin (zero in every dimension) is shown at the rear left corner of the bottom plane.
Each set of four consecutive lines represents a plane in the Y dimension.
Values in the X dimension increase to the right.
Values in the Z dimension increase down and toward the left.</p>

<h3>System Administration</h3>

<p>Building a Blue Gene compatible system is dependent upon the <i>configure</i>
program locating some expected files. You should see "#define HAVE_BGL 1" in 
the "config.h" file before making SLURM.</p>

<p>The slurmctld daemon should execute on the system's service node with 
an optional backup daemon on one of the front end nodes. 
One slurmd daemon should be configured to execute on one of the front end nodes. 
That one slurmd daemon represents communications channel for every base partition. 
You can use the scontrol command to drain individual nodes as desired and 
return them to service. </p>

<p>The slurm.conf (configuration) file needs to have the value of <i>InactiveLimit</i>
set to zero or not specified (it defaults to a value of zero). 
This is because there are no job steps and we don't want to purge jobs prematurely.
The value of <i>SelectType</i> must be set to "select/bluegene" in order to have 
node selection performed using a system aware of the system's topography 
and interfaces. 
The value of <i>SchedulerType</i> should be set to "sched/builtin".
Since jobs with different geometries or other characteristics do not interfere 
with each other's scheduling, backfill scheduling is not presently meaningful.
SLURM's builtin scheduler on Blue Gene will sort pending jobs and then attempt 
to schedule all of them in priority order. </p>

<p>SLURM node and partition descriptions should make use of the 
<a href="#naming">naming</a> conventions described above. For example,
"NodeName=bgl[000x733] NodeAddr=frontend0 Procs=1024". 
Note that the NodeAddr value for all 128 base partitions is the name 
of the front end node executing the slurmd daemon.</p>

<p>While users are unable to initiate SLURM job steps on Blue Gene systems, 
this restriction does not apply to user root or SlurmUser. 
Be advised that the one slurmd supporting all nodes is unable to manage a 
large number of job steps, so this ability should be used only to verify normal 
SLURM operation. 
If large numbers of job steps are initiated by slurmd, expect the daemon to 
fail due to lack of memory. </p>

<p>Presently the system administrator must explicitly define each of the 
Blue Gene job partitions available to execute jobs. 
(<b>NOTE:</b> Blue Gene job partitions are unrelated to SLURM partitions.)
Jobs must then execute in one of these pre-defined Blue Gene job partitions. 
This is known as <i>static partitioning</i>. 
Each of these Blue Gene job partitions is explicitly configured with
either a mesh or torus interconnect and either coprocessor or virtual 
c-node usage.
In addition to the normal <i>slurm.conf</i> file, a new <i>bluegene.conf</i>
configuration file is required with this information.
System administrators should use the smap tool to build appropriate 
configuration files for static partitioning. 
See the smap man page for more information.</p>

<p>At some time in the future, we expect SLURM to support <i>dynamic 
partitioning</i> in which Blue Gene job partitions are created and destroyed 
as needed to accomodate the workload.
At that time the <i>bluegene.conf</i> configuration file will become obsolete.
Dynamic partition does involve substantial overhead including the 
rebooting of c-nodes and I/O nodes.</p>
